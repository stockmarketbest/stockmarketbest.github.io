<h3 id="11-us-stocks-failing-to-replenish-the-truth-behind-the-cooling-cpi-medicine-and-market-indigestion"><strong>1.1 U.S. Stocks “Failing to Replenish”: The Truth Behind the Cooling CPI “Medicine” and Market Indigestion</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Binge and the Hangover</strong><br>
Yesterday, U.S. stocks stunned the world with a 12% violent rebound in the Nasdaq, only to see the S&amp;P 500 tumble 3.46% and the Nasdaq plunge 4.3% today. All three major indices experienced severe fluctuations. As some market pundits metaphorically described it, the Fed’s aggressive “CPI cooling medicine” (with March’s inflation data coming in well below expectations) may appear remedial but only treats the symptoms without addressing the underlying issues. In fact, market sentiment remains overheated, further complicated by excess liquidity and inconsistent policy signals—resulting in a deeper “indigestion crisis.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Lure and Pitfalls of CPI Data</strong><br>
U.S. March CPI figures showed a year-on-year increase of 2.4% (vs. an expected 2.5%), with core CPI easing to 2.8% (marking a two-month decline). While this suggests easing inflationary pressures, hidden dangers lurk beneath the surface. The “super core CPI” (excluding housing service costs) fell by 0.1% month-on-month, revealing fundamental weakness in real economic demand. The Fed's pre-emptive rate-cut expectations have already been priced in, yet the market overlooks a crucial caveat: a short-term drop in inflation does not equal a soft landing for the economy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="12-countdown-to-a-circuit-breaker-the-feds-power-out-card-and-the-capital-markets-suffocating-game"><strong>1.2 Countdown to a Circuit Breaker: The Fed’s “Power-Out” Card and the Capital Market’s Suffocating Game</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Haunting of Circuit Breakers: Approaching a Technical Meltdown</strong><br>
Intraday, the S&amp;P 500 hit a low, dropping 6.2% and coming dangerously close to triggering a circuit breaker. The harrowing memories of the March 2020 circuit breaker events have been revived. However, the Fed has long prepared a “power-out plan”—involving measures like manipulating trading platforms and halting algorithmic trading—to forcibly stabilize the market. In this scenario, the circuit breaker is not merely a market mechanism but a political instrument: should systemic risk materialize, the Fed would be compelled to reintroduce unlimited quantitative easing, though current political imperatives aiming to control inflation effectively rule out that option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Drying Up Liquidity: A Ticking Time Bomb for the U.S. Bond Market</strong><br>
The U.S. House recently passed legislation authorizing $5.3 trillion in tax cuts alongside a $5 trillion increase to the debt ceiling. While this might seem beneficial on the surface, it in fact exacerbates the “structural cancer” within the bond market. Massive Treasury issuances are set to disrupt the supply-demand balance, sending yields soaring. This scenario is evidenced by the 30-year U.K. gilt yield spiking to 5.64%—a level unseen since 1998—signaling that global long-term bonds have become “risk assets” and that the market is sliding toward a liquidity black hole.</p>

<h3 id="21-trumps-hidden-strategy-a-90-day-tariff-suspension-and-its-deadly-chess-move"><strong>2.1 Trump’s Hidden Strategy: A 90-Day Tariff Suspension and Its Deadly Chess Move</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Deleveraging U.S. Debt: A Financial Hostage Tactic Against China</strong><br>
President Trump’s announcement to pause tariffs is far from a conciliatory gesture; it is a calculated move designed to secure breathing room for the U.S. debt market. With China holding $1.1 trillion in U.S. Treasuries, any massive sell-off could burst the U.S. debt bubble. The 90-day tariff suspension window is essentially a countdown, pressuring China into accepting a “debt lifeline agreement” with the United States.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AI Chip Export Ban: Jensen Huang’s “Hampton Court Gamble”</strong><br>
In confidential discussions with President Trump, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang temporarily set aside restrictions on the sale of H20 chips to China. However, this is only a short-term fix: despite Chinese sales contributing 13% to NVIDIA’s revenue, the U.S. long-term strategy remains an AI embargo against China. Tech giants are thus forced to navigate a precarious path between maintaining technological supremacy and preserving profitability, fundamentally upending traditional valuation logic.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="22-europes-half-kneel-counterstrike-a-farcical-21-billion-euro-tariff-and-the-geopolitical-breakdown"><strong>2.2 Europe’s “Half-Kneel Counterstrike”: A Farcical 21-Billion-Euro Tariff and the Geopolitical Breakdown</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Symbolic Taxation: A Self-Deceiving Political Spectacle</strong><br>
The EU’s imposition of tariffs worth 21 billion euros on U.S. goods has been largely seen by markets as a hollow gesture—a mere display of defiant posturing. Deep-seated economic divisions within the EU (exemplified by Germany’s industrial decline and social unrest in France) have stripped it of genuine negotiating power, rendering the so-called “retaliation” little more than a face-saving maneuver.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Europe’s Dilemma Under Dollar Hegemony</strong><br>
Faced with a crisis of confidence, the Bank of England swiftly abandoned its long-term bond sales and shifted towards short-term debt instruments, exposing the fragility of European capital markets. The Eurozone now functions as a dumping ground for the fallout of the U.S. Fed’s rate hikes—setting the stage for a potential resurgence of sovereign debt crises and bank runs.</p>

<h3 id="31-the-sp-500s-death-spiral-fibonacci-retracements-and-institutional-long-short-hunts"><strong>3.1 The S&amp;P 500’s “Death Spiral”: Fibonacci Retracements and Institutional Long-Short Hunts</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>5,500 Points: The Graveyard for Bulls and the Carnival for Bears</strong><br>
The S&amp;P 500 has encountered a “double whammy” at 5,500 points, suffering from both a “bear gap” and a 50% Fibonacci retracement—a technical level that experts now label as the “end of the bull market rally.” On a deeper level, institutions are leveraging algorithmic trading to engineer false breakouts that lure retail investors into disadvantageous positions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Psychological Warfare of Circuit Breakers</strong><br>
The Fed’s constant threat of triggering circuit breakers is a deliberate tactic to instill market panic, thereby pushing capital towards “safe haven” assets like government bonds—a strategy that, in effect, paves the way for expanding its debt. In this framework, the circuit breaker has transformed from a mere risk indicator into a potent policy tool.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="32-the-sacrificial-lambs-of-chinese-stocks-the-deflationary-phantom-and-tariff-guillotine"><strong>3.2 The Sacrificial Lambs of Chinese Stocks: The Deflationary Phantom and Tariff Guillotine</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>China’s March CPI at -0.1%: A Fatal Signal of Deflation</strong><br>
With China registering negative CPI growth for two consecutive months, the data not only signals waning domestic demand but also foreshadows a slide into “balance sheet recession” in the world’s second-largest economy. Chinese stocks, especially those listed in the U.S., have become collateral damage in the broader U.S.-China confrontation—witnessing capital flight, halved valuations, and paralyzed liquidity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The IWM Small-Cap Index: The First Casualties Under the Fed’s Rate Hike Scythe</strong><br>
The IWM index is teetering near its bear market lows of 2022. Small enterprises, unable to offset the burden of tariff costs and hindered by a lack of financing options, are facing accelerated decline. The Fed’s implicit policy of “protecting the giants at the expense of the little guys” is laying bare its approach: sacrificing small businesses to stabilize inflation readings, a move critics liken to self-administered poison.</p>

<h3 id="41-the-mirage-of-a-june-rate-cut-the-feds-prisoners-dilemma-and-the-markets-backlash"><strong>4.1 The Mirage of a June Rate Cut: The Fed’s “Prisoner’s Dilemma” and the Market’s Backlash</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Rate-Cut Expectations: A Masterfully Orchestrated Collective Illusion</strong><br>
While markets have been betting on a rate cut in June, Fed officials have uniformly taken a hawkish stance, prioritizing inflation control. This unified message serves as a smokescreen designed to cover up the massive issuance of U.S. debt. In reality, a rate cut remains highly unlikely, with market stability maintained only through the power of “expectations management.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Liquidity Winter: The Nonlinear Collapse of Algorithmic Trading Systems</strong><br>
Dominated by high-frequency and algorithm-driven strategies, the market teeters on the edge of a nonlinear collapse. In the event of a sweeping sell-off in U.S. Treasuries, the intricate web of programmatic trading could trigger a catastrophic “death spiral”—a perfect storm where multiple risk factors resonate simultaneously.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="42-investment-lessons-finding-blood-stained-diamonds-amid-the-capital-meat-grinder"><strong>4.2 Investment Lessons: Finding Blood-Stained Diamonds Amid the Capital Meat Grinder</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Cash is King: The Survival Rule of Maintaining a 50% Position</strong><br>
A critical technical threshold lies at the 250-day moving average of the S&amp;P 500 (at 5,646 points), beyond which a “bear trap” may be imminent. In turbulent times like these, maintaining a cash reserve exceeding 50% of one’s portfolio is the only viable lifeboat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Counter-Cyclical Hunting: The Dialectic of Survival in Airline and Chip Stocks</strong><br>
The dramatic 23% plunge and subsequent rebound of Delta Airlines are more reflective of transient sentiment swings than fundamental recovery. Similarly, companies like NVIDIA must strictly adhere to a “10% position red line.” Only when deep intrinsic value (with a cash flow discount rate &gt;20%) converges with extreme market undervaluation (price-to-book ratio &lt;0.5) does the opportunity arise to decisively enter the market.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Conclusion: A War with No Victors</strong><br>
From the Fed’s monetary policies to the geopolitical tussle between the U.S. and China, from the looming threat of a U.S. debt crisis to the tragic fate of retail investors caught in a leverage trap, the capital market landscape in 2025 has transcended traditional economic cycles. It has become an arena for great power politics. The one certainty remains: when the chorus of “this time is different” grows too loud, the noose of history is already tightening.</p>
