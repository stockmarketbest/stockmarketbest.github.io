                <p>April 17, 2025. The stock market is like a neurotic patient, sometimes revitalized by the shot in the arm of earnings reports, and other times suffocated by the clouds of a tariff war. TSMC flexed its muscles, UnitedHealth took a tumble, Eli Lilly laughed as its competitors crashed, while META sank deeper into the mire of advertising revenue. On this day, the three major stock indexes were like passengers strapped into a roller coaster, surging and then falling back, with mixed results. Only the S&amp;P managed to hold its ground, while the Nasdaq and Dow Jones limped to the finish line. This was no ordinary trading day; it was a collective frenzy of humanity, greed, and fear dancing on the candlestick charts.</p>
<p>Below, we will peel back the market's surface to delve into the logic and undercurrents behind this chaos. From the market's overreactions to the life-and-death struggle in the chip sector, the disillusionment with healthcare insurance stocks as safe havens, the bloody battle in the weight-loss drug market, and the hidden crisis of META's advertising empire, each sector holds truths that could upend your understanding. Are you ready? Let's dive headfirst into this financial arena.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-market-sentiment-a-barometer-of-the-stock-market-or-a-nervous-breakdown">1. Market Sentiment: A Barometer of the Stock Market or a Nervous Breakdown?</h2>
<h3 id="11-tariff-war-the-psychological-curve-from-panic-to-numbness">1.1 Tariff War: The Psychological Curve from Panic to Numbness</h3>
<p>The tariff war, like a sword of Damocles hanging overhead, has gone from an initial thunderclap to background noise. Trump's statement today that &quot;significant progress has been made in negotiations with Japan&quot; felt like taking half a tranquilizer, causing the three major stock indexes to open slightly higher, attempting to recover from yesterday's heavy losses. Unfortunately, no one knows if this &quot;progress&quot; is real money or just another round of empty rhetoric. The second round of negotiations won't happen until the end of the month, leaving investors twiddling their thumbs waiting for the next episode.</p>
<p>Even better, Trump casually tweeted that he was &quot;very confident&quot; about a trade agreement with the EU, but added &quot;no rush.&quot; This is like walking a tightrope, teasing the market without providing concrete evidence. Looking back to the beginning of the month, when the tariff policies were first announced, the market reacted like a hornet's nest had been kicked, with wave after wave of panic selling. And now? The news changes daily, with talks sometimes collapsing and sometimes leading to handshakes. The volatility remains, but the trend is gone. Investors seem to have developed Stockholm syndrome, their reaction to tariffs shifting from hysteria to &quot;Oh, here we go again.&quot;</p>
<p>What does this mean? The darkest period of panic may be over, but don't celebrate too soon. The market's desensitization to tariffs doesn't mean the risk has disappeared; it means everyone is learning to dance on the edge of a knife. The question is, how long can this balance be maintained? If negotiations with a major country truly collapse, will the market jump from numbness directly to collapse?</p>
<h3 id="12-earnings-reports-a-lifeline-or-the-last-straw">1.2 Earnings Reports: A Lifeline or the Last Straw?</h3>
<p>Earnings season is the litmus test for a company's true colors and an amplifier of market sentiment. TSMC delivered a dazzling report today: Q1 revenue surged 41.6%, and net profit soared 60.3%, directly pulling the chip sector's sentiment from the ICU back to the emergency room. Netflix also exceeded expectations after hours, electrifying tech stocks. Unfortunately, &quot;bad apples&quot; like Nvidia, Google, and UnitedHealth dragged the three major indexes back into the mire. UnitedHealth, in particular, with a worse-than-expected earnings report, single-handedly caused the Dow to plummet 1.33%, proving to be an &quot;anti-MVP&quot; that took down ten others.</p>
<p>The impact of earnings reports is never just a simple numbers game; it's a collision between expectations and reality. TSMC's optimistic guidance ignited hopes for AI chips, while UnitedHealth's earnings disaster stunned safe-haven investors. Investors are split into two groups: gamblers chasing growth and cowards clinging to cash. This divided sentiment directly led to the boring drama of intraday volatility. Earnings season has just begun, and a bunch of big names are lined up to take the stage next week. Wall Street predicts a 6.7% earnings growth for S&amp;P 500 constituents in Q1, but can we trust this number? Don't forget, this is already the result after downward revisions earlier this year.</p>
<h3 id="13-psychology-and-logic-humanity-running-naked-in-this-game">1.3 Psychology and Logic: Humanity Running Naked in this Game</h3>
<p>Market sentiment is never just a rational candlestick chart; it's a stark projection of human nature. Labor market data gave another surprise today: initial jobless claims fell to 215,000, well below the expected 225,000, and 228,000 jobs were added in March, directly refuting Wall Street's recession theories. Unfortunately, this good news was quickly overwhelmed by UnitedHealth's plunge and Nvidia's tariff anxieties.</p>
<p>Investors are now like startled birds, guessing the plot by watching Trump's tweets and counting earnings reports with their fingers. Shorts don't dare hold positions, longs don't dare chase highs, and institutions even sniffed out the benefits of TSMC and Netflix in advance, covering their positions early. This &quot;one-day-at-a-time&quot; rhythm has turned the market into an amplified version of a short-term gambling den. The question is, how long can this psychological game last? The 10-day moving average has become a key support level; holding it offers hope for a rebound, breaking it means heading straight for 5000 points. Don't ask me where the trend is; I don't know eitherâ€”who dares to confidently say they see the direction clearly now?</p>

<h2 id="2-chip-sector-a-life-and-death-struggle-in-the-shadow-of-tariffs">2. Chip Sector: A Life-and-Death Struggle in the Shadow of Tariffs</h2>
<h3 id="21-tariffs-the-invisible-noose-around-the-chip-industry">2.1 Tariffs: The Invisible Noose Around the Chip Industry</h3>
<p>Chip stocks rode a roller coaster today; TSMC's earnings report ignited hope, while Nvidia's and Intel's plunges poured cold water on it. The tariff knife hasn't actually fallen yet, but its shadow has already enveloped the entire industry. Old Huang (Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang) finally relented, admitting that the latest chip ban has a huge impact, and even chose a sensitive time to run to Beijing to &quot;explain.&quot; This move is truly perplexing; H20 is gone, customers are anxious, but he insists on running into the eye of the storm.</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase was even more direct, predicting that the chip sector may enter an &quot;earnings downgrade cycle,&quot; with EPS expectations for the next few quarters being significantly revised downward, and stock prices having another 10%-15% downside. Think about it: if tariffs actually land, supply chain costs will soar, demand-side uncertainty will increase, and can chip stocks still hold on? Don't forget, this industry is already a high-investment, high-risk game; tariffs are just throwing another match into the powder keg.</p>
<h3 id="22-tsmc-ai-savior-or-the-last-hurrah">2.2 TSMC: AI Savior or the Last Hurrah?</h3>
<p>TSMC was the lifeline for the chip sector today. The Q1 earnings report exceeded expectations, with both revenue and net profit soaring, and the surge in AI chip demand became the biggest driver. Even more impressive, the company's guidance remained optimistic, with a long-term gross margin expectation of 53% unchanged, and management's confidence in structural growth overflowing. But Bank of America poured cold water on it, lowering the target price, citing demand uncertainty brought by tariffs.</p>
<p>This logic is interesting: TSMC's growth may be the result of customers frantically hoarding before tariffs land. Once policies tighten, will demand plummet? But on the other hand, the AI boom has just begun, and TSMC, as the global foundry leader, has a position that no one can shake in the short term. Is the stock price pullback a risk or an opportunity? At least for now, it is still the stabilizing force of the chip sector.</p>
<h3 id="23-intel-the-fall-from-king-to-underdog">2.3 Intel: The Fall from King to Underdog</h3>
<p>Intel was another disaster site today, with its stock price falling to a new low for the year. Even the TSMC CEO came out to deny rumors of a &quot;joint venture,&quot; directly cutting off the last shred of outside fantasy. Wells Fargo also added insult to injury, downgrading the rating, citing the dual impact of US-China tariffs. What happened to this company? From the king of the PC era to being rubbed on the ground by TSMC, technological backwardness, strategic errors, and tariff pressures, Intel seems to be a child abandoned by the times.</p>
<p>But don't rush to pronounce a death sentence. Intel still has cards in its hand, such as US government chip subsidies and the strategic value of domestic manufacturing. However, whether these cards can save lives depends on execution. In the short term, Intel is a landmine among chip stocks; whoever touches it explodes.</p>

<h2 id="3-healthcare-insurance-stocks-a-sudden-change-in-the-safe-haven">3. Healthcare Insurance Stocks: A Sudden Change in the Safe Haven</h2>
<h3 id="31-unitedhealth-from-golden-boy-to-plunge-pioneer">3.1 UnitedHealth: From Golden Boy to Plunge Pioneer</h3>
<p>UnitedHealth became the culprit of the Dow today, with its earnings report completely failing: revenue growth of 9.8% fell short of expectations, profits crashed, full-year earnings guidance was lowered, and the stock price gapped down and plunged 22%. This is not an ordinary mistake, but a fatal blow to market confidence. Rising costs are the main reason, but there is a deeper story behind it: institutions taking the opportunity to run away.</p>
<p>In the past few weeks, when the market was turbulent, funds treated healthcare insurance stocks as a safe haven, and UnitedHealth's stock price was driven up. Now that the panic has subsided and the earnings report is poor, funds are ruthlessly cashing out and leaving. This operation is too harsh, dragging the entire sector down with it.</p>
<h3 id="32-safe-haven-logic-myth-broken-or-temporary-adjustment">3.2 Safe Haven Logic: Myth Broken or Temporary Adjustment?</h3>
<p>Healthcare insurance stocks have always been a representative of defensive assets, with a simple logic: no matter how bad the economy is, people still need to see a doctor. But today's plunge exposed the problem: safe haven is not a panacea. UnitedHealth's cost pressures may only be the tip of the iceberg. Changes in medical insurance policies, aging populations, and soaring medical costs are all brewing in secret. Once the sector loses its safe-haven aura, where will the funds flow?</p>
<h3 id="33-capital-flow-the-cycle-from-safe-haven-to-profit-seeking">3.3 Capital Flow: The Cycle from Safe Haven to Profit-Seeking</h3>
<p>Funds never speak of feelings. Before UnitedHealth's plunge, institutions had already smelled something was wrong, and today they just took advantage of the earnings report to kick it while it was down. The rise of healthcare insurance stocks is difficult to sustain in the short term, but don't rush to sing their dirge. If the market becomes turbulent again, these types of stocks may be pulled out again to take the hit. The key is to see if the earnings reports of other healthcare insurance stocks next week can save some face.</p>

<h2 id="4-weight-loss-drug-war-the-bloody-showdown-between-eli-lilly-and-novo-nordisk">4. Weight Loss Drug War: The Bloody Showdown Between Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk</h2>
<h3 id="41-market-pattern-from-melee-to-duel">4.1 Market Pattern: From Melee to Duel</h3>
<p>The weight loss drug market exploded today. Eli Lilly's new drug ACHIEVE-1 Phase III trial data was impressive, with effects crushing Novo Nordisk's Ozempic, and the stock price gapped up sharply. If all goes well, it could be launched in early 2026, with unrestricted supply. On the other hand, Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and Ozempic demand fell short of expectations, and two drugs in development also failed. The company also lost its title as the most valuable company in the European stock market this month.</p>
<p>This is not ordinary competition, but a life-and-death brawl. Pfizer is even more miserable, directly exiting the race, and weight loss drugs have become a two-man show for Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. The market space is huge, but the logic of &quot;winner takes all&quot; is even more obvious.</p>
<h3 id="42-eli-lilly-a-carnival-of-perfect-timing">4.2 Eli Lilly: A Carnival of Perfect Timing</h3>
<p>Eli Lilly is now riding high, with successful trials, competitors crashing, and even luck on its side. If the new drug can be launched as planned, the global obesity problem will be its ATM. But don't forget that the stock price of pharmaceutical companies never only depends on products, but also on expectations. Eli Lilly is now at its peak, but once subsequent data fails or regulatory hurdles arise, it will fall faster than it rose.</p>
<h3 id="43-novo-nordisk-a-waterloo-from-peak-to-valley">4.3 Novo Nordisk: A Waterloo from Peak to Valley</h3>
<p>Novo Nordisk's operation can be called a textbook example of a crash. Weak demand, R&amp;D setbacks, and market value evaporation are simply bad luck. The problem is that the company's foundation is still there, and the first-mover advantage of Ozempic and Wegovy is not to be underestimated. Although Eli Lilly is strong, Novo Nordisk may not be out of the game. The war for weight loss drugs has just begun, and it's hard to say who will have the last laugh.</p>

<h2 id="5-meta-the-silent-collapse-of-the-advertising-empire">5. META: The Silent Collapse of the Advertising Empire</h2>
<h3 id="51-the-betrayal-of-chinese-e-commerce-the-revenue-lifeline-is-cut-off">5.1 The Betrayal of Chinese E-Commerce: The Revenue Lifeline is Cut Off</h3>
<p>META's stock price has been declining for days, and today it suffered a new injury. Sensor Tower data shows that Chinese e-commerce giants Temu and Shein cut their advertising spending by 31% and 19% respectively in two weeks, and META is the first to bear the brunt. Last year, the Chinese market contributed $18.4 billion in revenue, accounting for more than 10% of total revenue, and this knife is directly stabbed into the lifeline.</p>
<p>The reduction in spending by Chinese e-commerce companies is not accidental; it may be cost control or a strategic shift. META's earnings report at the end of the month will be the focus, with investors staring at capital expenditures and guidance. The stock price has already fallen 35% from its peak, and its valuation is at the bottom of the Magnificent Seven. Buy it again at $450? Don't dream; before the trend reverses, bottom-fishing is like catching a falling knife.</p>
<h3 id="52-response-strategy-can-meta-still-be-saved">5.2 Response Strategy: Can META Still Be Saved?</h3>
<p>META is not without tricks. AI advertising optimization, metaverse bets, and short video traffic are all chips for a comeback. But the reality is cruel; the hole in the Chinese market cannot be filled in the short term, and competitors are still watching. If advertising revenue continues to shrink, META's cash cow myth will have to be rewritten.</p>
<h3 id="53-prospects-from-hegemon-to-lost-giant">5.3 Prospects: From Hegemon to Lost Giant?</h3>
<p>META's problem is not just advertising, but also strategy. Zuckerberg's metaverse dream is burning countless money, but the returns are far away. Now that advertising revenue is having problems again, will this social empire slide from its peak to mediocrity? The earnings report next week is a key node; surviving it offers hope, but failing it is truly dangerous.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclusion-do-troubled-times-produce-heroes-or-do-heroes-grow-old">Conclusion: Do Troubled Times Produce Heroes, or Do Heroes Grow Old?</h2>
<p>The stock market on April 17, 2025, is a mixture of chaos, opportunity, and risk. TSMC is holding up the chip banner, UnitedHealth is bruised and battered, Eli Lilly is laughing at the weight loss drug market, and META is struggling in the advertising fog. Under the dual attack of the tariff war and earnings reports, no one is an absolute winner, and no one is a complete loser.</p>
<p>The market is never rational; it is an amplifier of human nature. Investors sway between greed and fear, institutions look for opportunities in volatility, and retail investors look for faith in candlestick charts. The upcoming earnings season and trade negotiations will determine whether this drama is full of climaxes or ends quietly. What about you? Are you willing to take a gamble, or do you choose to wait and see? Don't ask me for the answer; I am only responsible for laying out the truth, and the rest depends on your own courage.</p>
