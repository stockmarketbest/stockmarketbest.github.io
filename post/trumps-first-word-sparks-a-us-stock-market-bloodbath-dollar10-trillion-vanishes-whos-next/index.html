                <h2 id="opening-trumps-nuclear-bomb-hits-the-market-investors-tremble">Opening: Trump’s “Nuclear Bomb” Hits the Market, Investors Tremble</h2>
<p>On Tuesday, March 11, the U.S. market had barely caught its breath at the open—with the Nasdaq up 0.8%—when one sentence from Trump sent it reeling. Out of the blue, he announced that in retaliation for Ontario’s new tariffs on U.S. electricity, he would impose an extra 25% duty on Canadian steel and aluminum, pushing total tariffs to 50% effective the very next day. Moreover, he threatened to “permanently shut down” Canada’s auto industry by significantly raising tariffs on imported vehicles starting April 2. The news hit like a bombshell: indices plummeted, and despite a brief midday reprieve, the close was grim—S&amp;P 500 down 0.76%, Nasdaq down 0.18%, and the Dow down 1.14%.</p>
<p>This wasn’t an isolated incident—it’s become Trump’s “new normal.” From Monday to Sunday, before, during, and after trading, he hurls “nuclear bombs” at any time, completely ignoring the unwritten rule that major policy moves are announced after hours to give the market time to digest. Instead, he deliberately disrupts the opening bell, clearly aiming to shake investor confidence. Short-term traders are left reeling, while long-term players watch helplessly as trends collapse. In Trump’s view, it’s not about the market’s direction; it’s about lowering yields, reducing federal debt interest, and cutting corporate financing costs. With some institutions predicting the S&amp;P could fall to between 4,900 and 5,300—a decline of 14% to 20%—this isn’t a mere correction, it’s a massacre.</p>
<p>Market sentiment is as bleak as doomsday, yet the promise of a Fed rate cut hints that the euphoria could soon return. The pressing question remains: who dares bet on tomorrow? With Trump’s policies as erratic as ever, key CPI and PPI data on the horizon, and U.S.-Canada trade negotiations kicking off on Thursday, no one can say if the next moment will bring a rebound or a deeper plunge.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="i-trumps-mad-dog-economics-turning-the-stock-market-into-his-personal-atm">I. Trump’s “Mad Dog Economics”: Turning the Stock Market into His Personal ATM</h2>
<h2 id="11-policy-bombshells-at-any-time-rules-trampled-underfoot">1.1 Policy Bombshells at Any Time, Rules Trampled Underfoot</h2>
<p>Trump’s latest maneuvers are pure “mad dog mode.” There’s an unspoken rule in U.S. markets: major policy announcements should be made after hours to avoid intraday shocks—much like corporate earnings are released before or after trading. But Trump disregards this norm completely. From hinting at moves during last Friday’s close earlier this year to now lobbing shocks at any moment, he’s determined to catch the market off guard. One day he reassured that U.S.-Canada talks were easing; the next, he threatened to crush the auto industry. Who can handle this roller coaster?</p>
<p>This isn’t a misstep—it’s deliberate. He chooses to speak at market open precisely to generate panic and amplify volatility. Retail investors flee, institutions get trapped, and market liquidity crumbles. The result? In just three months, U.S. stocks evaporated $4 trillion, the crypto market lost another $6 trillion, and $10 trillion in wealth turned to dust. According to the Financial Times, the Trump family pocketed $350 million from TRUMP Coin alone, with other undisclosed gains piling up. This isn’t presidential leadership—it’s turning the market into a personal ATM.</p>
<h2 id="12-indifference-to-the-stock-market-only-focused-on-lowering-yields">1.2 Indifference to the Stock Market, Only Focused on Lowering Yields</h2>
<p>Trump’s team follows a blunt logic: a stock market crash is acceptable if it forces U.S. Treasury yields lower, thereby reducing federal debt interest and corporate borrowing costs. A 10% drop in the S&amp;P or a technical pullback in the Nasdaq means little when viewed through the lens of macro leverage—the market is merely a pawn on their chessboard. Yet for investors, it’s a disaster. RBC has warned of rising bear market risks, while Evercore ISI has bluntly predicted stagflation, estimating the S&amp;P might fall to around 5,200 points. Once bullish reports from the start of the year have been scrapped, leaving everyone on edge.</p>
<p>What’s even more ruthless is that Trump isn’t afraid of being understood. He openly declares that he doesn’t care if the market falls—in fact, he welcomes it. Retail traders are switching from day trading to waiting on the sidelines, and long-term funds hesitate to enter, as investor confidence is shattered. The question remains: how long can this “mad dog economics” approach last? Lowering yields through fear might work for a while, but if the fundamentals collapse, who will fix the mess?</p>
<h2 id="13-the-market-as-an-emotional-amplifier-with-retail-investors-as-sacrificial-lambs">1.3 The Market as an Emotional Amplifier, with Retail Investors as Sacrificial Lambs</h2>
<p>Every time Trump drops a bombshell, the market experiences an emotional roller coaster. When the U.S.-Canada trade dispute escalates, indices dive; when news of a ceasefire in Ukraine emerges, there’s another dip; and ultimately, the day ends lower. Investors are being toyed with, and retail investors suffer the most. Extreme intraday volatility leaves many forced to shift strategies—and as soon as Trump speaks, technical analysis becomes useless and stop-loss orders come too late. The result? Buying the dip halfway up or betting on a rebound only to end up as the scapegoat. While oversold conditions might trigger a brief “dead cat bounce,” who’s willing to risk that the next move won’t plunge even deeper?</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="ii-the-aftermath-of-the-us-stock-market-bloodbath-whos-exposed-and-whos-buying-the-dip">II. The Aftermath of the U.S. Stock Market Bloodbath: Who’s Exposed and Who’s Buying the Dip?</h2>
<h2 id="21-fallen-giants-apple-takes-a-hit-airlines-crash">2.1 Fallen Giants: Apple Takes a Hit, Airlines Crash</h2>
<p>Among the major tech giants, Apple has taken the worst blow—its shares fell another 2.9% today. Analysts had already warned investors not to try catching falling knives, and this correction shows no sign of abating. With the S&amp;P dropping below 5,528 points, a technical pullback seems inevitable, and high-valuation stocks like Apple are hit first. Despite robust cash flow, once consumer demand weakens and supply chain pressures mount, even Apple isn’t immune.</p>
<p>The airline sector fared even worse. Delta Air Lines experienced a post-market debacle yesterday, slashing its Q1 revenue and profit forecasts by half, sending its stock into freefall. The CEO bluntly attributed the downturn to economic uncertainty that has crushed corporate spending and consumer demand—even government orders have dried up. Wall Street had believed Delta’s high-end clientele would cushion the blow, but that hope was dashed. Other traditional airlines have followed suit with downgraded forecasts, splitting the sector—while legacy carriers tumble, low-cost airlines see gains. The brutal logic is simple: when consumers tighten their belts, they opt for cheaper flights. Delta now serves as a bellwether for an economic downturn; if you’re thinking of buying the dip, be prepared for even lower levels before a recovery.</p>
<h2 id="22-tech-dreams-shattered-oracles-ai-surge-fizzles-bitcoin-bleeds">2.2 Tech Dreams Shattered: Oracle’s AI Surge Fizzles, Bitcoin Bleeds</h2>
<p>Oracle’s earnings report yesterday proved disappointing—revenues of $14.13 billion missed expectations and its cloud business growth slowed, sending its stock tumbling. Last year, riding the AI bandwagon, Oracle surged by 60%; this year, it’s down 13%. With the AI hype subsiding, no one is immune. Even though the company inked cloud agreements with OpenAI and Meta and set a revenue target of $66 billion for the next fiscal year, Wall Street remains skeptical. The heavy costs of data center expansion and lackluster guidance leave investors unconvinced.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency market fared even worse. Bitcoin slid back into its expected range of $70,000–$80,000, evaporating 25% from its highs, and the overall market cap of the crypto sector shrank by $6 trillion. Since Trump took office, his policies on crypto reserves have dried up—the government is not buying but merely holding confiscated coins, and hot money is fleeing, leading to Bitcoin’s sharp decline. Both COIN and HOOD fell 20% yesterday, and even today’s rebound wasn’t enough to salvage them. HOOD, in particular, has been abandoned by retail investors as trading volumes plummeted and its stock price was slashed from $67. Many who bought the dip now face a 15% loss, planning to sell on any rebound and re-enter only when prices drop into double digits.</p>
<h2 id="23-broadcom-and-nvidia-lose-their-luster-while-pharma-giants-also-stumble">2.3 Broadcom and Nvidia Lose Their Luster, While Pharma Giants Also Stumble</h2>
<p>The AI chip titans Broadcom and Nvidia have also cooled off—Nvidia fell 29% and Broadcom dropped 28.6%, with last Friday’s earnings failing to prop up their stocks. Investors worry that tech giants may postpone their AI spending and that economic turbulence is triggering a withdrawal of capital. Adding insult to injury, Broadcom got entangled in controversy with TSMC when it hinted at acquiring Intel—only for its executives to flatly deny the rumor, sending its shares spiraling.</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical sector hasn’t been spared either. Novo Nordisk’s new weight loss drug, CagriSema, delivered only a 15.7% reduction—far short of the 25% expectation—causing its stock to plunge 9.4%. Last December, it had already fallen 17.8%, erasing $100 billion in market cap. While today’s drop is relatively milder, investor confidence is severely shaken. Even though Eli Lilly remains highly valued and relatively stable, Novo Nordisk’s weakening fundamentals are becoming increasingly apparent.</p>

<h2 id="iii-survival-strategies-for-traders-buying-the-dip-or-betting-on-a-rebound">III. Survival Strategies for Traders: Buying the Dip or Betting on a Rebound?</h2>
<h2 id="31-confusing-buying-the-dip-with-betting-on-a-rebound-is-a-recipe-for-disaster">3.1 Confusing Buying the Dip with Betting on a Rebound Is a Recipe for Disaster</h2>
<p>The market is oversold and a technical rebound could occur at any moment—yet don’t celebrate prematurely. Buying the dip means having faith in long-term value and being willing to add positions when prices fall; betting on a rebound is a short-term wager on a technical correction, fully aware that the bottom may still be far off. Mixing the two strategies can lead to ruin.</p>
<p>If you’re aiming to bet on a rebound, keep your positions light, set stop-loss orders, and be ready to exit swiftly. If the market continues to fall, either cut your losses or hold while waiting for the bottom—but don’t add more positions impulsively. If your strategy is to buy the dip, accumulate gradually by placing low-price orders instead of going all in. Delta Air Lines serves as a prime example: even after its sharp decline, lower entry points remain, so rushing in could simply be like throwing money away.</p>
<h2 id="32-data-is-destiny-cpi-ppi-and-us-canada-negotiations">3.2 Data Is Destiny: CPI, PPI, and U.S.-Canada Negotiations</h2>
<p>Tomorrow’s CPI and Thursday’s PPI figures will be crucial. The CPI offers a cautiously optimistic outlook, bolstered by Walmart’s lowered guidance amid weak consumer demand and moderated prices. However, the PPI looks grim—firms stockpiled ahead of tariffs, making it hard to pass on rising costs, which could drive inflation higher. Even if the data come in strong, Trump’s unpredictable policy shifts could undo any gains. With U.S.-Canada trade talks on Thursday resembling a ticking time bomb, a collapse in negotiations could trigger another market drop; even a successful deal might not spark a rally—who’s willing to bet against a sudden turnaround?</p>
<h2 id="33-capital-flow-from-bonds-to-stocks-initial-buying-signals-emerge">3.3 Capital Flow: From Bonds to Stocks, Initial Buying Signals Emerge</h2>
<p>Today, yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury have risen, prompting a shift of funds from the bond market back into stocks in search of bargains. While there are early signs of buying, nothing definitive has emerged yet. Whether this trend continues depends largely on overall market sentiment. For short-term traders betting on a rebound, quick entries and exits—with tight position management—are essential. For long-term investors, patience is key; the bear market isn’t over yet, and the real test will be how the market behaves between 4,900 and 5,200 points.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="iv-the-future-how-long-can-trumps-frenzy-last">IV. The Future: How Long Can Trump’s Frenzy Last?</h2>
<h2 id="41-with-10-trillion-evaporated-hes-profitedbut-whos-left-suffering">4.1 With $10 Trillion Evaporated, He’s Profited—But Who’s Left Suffering?</h2>
<p>In just three months, $4 trillion has vanished from U.S. stocks and another $6 trillion from the cryptocurrency sector—a total of $10 trillion wiped out. The Trump family has already pocketed $350 million from TRUMP Coin alone, with other operations raking in even more. While retail investors are left with nothing and institutions are in disarray, even Elon Musk’s touted DOGE savings of $1 trillion pale in comparison to Trump’s billions earned by effectively “shorting” the market. The pressing question is: how long can this strategy hold up? If economic fundamentals collapse and the market drops another 20%, what will be his next move?</p>
<h2 id="42-the-feds-intervention-is-the-only-hope-for-a-turnaround">4.2 The Fed’s Intervention Is the Only Hope for a Turnaround</h2>
<p>Market sentiment is deeply pessimistic, but the Federal Reserve remains the wild card. Once a rate cut is announced, investor mood could flip in an instant, reigniting market euphoria. Bitcoin might slip to $70K before June, but a Fed intervention could send it soaring back. Similarly, if U.S. stocks fall to 5,200 points, the Fed will likely step in regardless. Yet the big uncertainty remains: will Trump’s reckless yield-suppressing tactics force the Fed to act prematurely?</p>
<h2 id="43-traders-doomsday-survival-guide">4.3 Traders’ Doomsday Survival Guide</h2>
<p>For short-term traders: monitor every word from Trump, remain agile, and don’t get greedy—small, quick gains are key. For longer-term investors: cash is king; wait until the market nears 4,900 points before making a move. And for retail investors: keep your expectations in check, rein in your impulses, and focus on survival. With market trends shifting rapidly, gains in a rising market may be modest, but losses in a falling market can be devastating. As long as Trump remains at the helm, the hemorrhage of wealth is unlikely to stop.</p>

<p>At the drop of his voice, Trump has transformed the U.S. stock market into a bloodbath, turning $10 trillion in wealth to dust. Who will be the next victim—Apple, Delta, Bitcoin, or the positions in your own portfolio? As the market trembles in fear and traders struggle amid relentless volatility, one thing is certain: uncertainty reigns supreme. This massacre has only just begun—rather than asking where the bottom is, ask yourself how much longer you can endure.</p>
