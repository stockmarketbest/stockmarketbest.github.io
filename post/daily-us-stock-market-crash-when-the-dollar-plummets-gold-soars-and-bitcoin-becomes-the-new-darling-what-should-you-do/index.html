                <h3 id="opening-the-market-crashes-again-and-again-trumps-verbal-barrage-ignites-a-selling-frenzy">Opening: The Market Crashes Again and Again, Trump's &quot;Verbal Barrage&quot; Ignites a Selling Frenzy</h3>
<p>Today is April 21, 2025, Monday. Just after the long weekend, the market couldn't wait to stage a massive sell-off. The three major stock indexes opened lower and continued to fall, barely managing to recover some ground in the late session, likely because short-term shorts were afraid of holding overnight and rushed to cover their positions. Unfortunately, this struggle was futile. At the close, all three major indexes fell by more than 2%, and all 11 sectors were wiped out. More than 9,000 stocks in the market were hammered down, with fewer than 3,000 daring to rise. Since Trump took office as &quot;President,&quot; crashes have become as commonplace as eating and drinking. The former myth of &quot;more ups than downs&quot; in the US stock market has been completely shattered. The VIX panic index jumped above 30 again, and market sentiment is as tense as a drawn bowstring—no one knows when it will break.</p>
<p>The trigger for this sell-off? Trump opened his &quot;verbal barrage&quot; again. This time, he targeted Federal Reserve Chairman Powell, threatening to fire him, and also dissed the progress of tariff negotiations. Risk aversion surged instantly, and investors dumped US assets like they were free. The dollar, US bonds, and US stocks all plummeted, a triple whammy without hesitation. Don't ask, it's just &quot;Trump's style.&quot; The market has long been accustomed to this &quot;mad dog operation.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="i-the-dollar-falls-like-a-weakling-and-the-feds-independence-becomes-a-joke">I. The Dollar Falls Like a &quot;Weakling,&quot; and the Fed's Independence Becomes a Joke</h3>
<h4 id="dollar-index-refreshes-three-year-low-98-becomes-a-psychological-defense-line">Dollar Index Refreshes Three-Year Low, 98 Becomes a &quot;Psychological Defense Line&quot;</h4>
<p>The dollar has truly &quot;broken through the bottom line&quot; this time—the Dollar Index once fell below 98 during the day, hitting a three-year low. According to CFTC data, hedge funds' bearish sentiment towards the dollar has soared to its highest level since last October. Trump not only verbally threatened to kick out Powell but also threatened to interfere with the Fed's monetary policy, crushing the Fed's &quot;independence&quot; to pieces. In fact, this independence was just a façade, as everyone knew. But now that even the façade is gone, how can the market not panic?</p>
<h4 id="trumps-devaluation-dream-manufacturing-savior-or-market-nightmare">Trump's &quot;Devaluation Dream&quot;: Manufacturing Savior or Market Nightmare?</h4>
<p>Some say that the dollar's weakness may be intentional on Trump's part. After all, he has long complained that a strong dollar hurts the competitiveness of US manufacturing. Now that the dollar has fallen so much, the prices of exported goods are lower, and US goods may sell a few more units. But the problem is that the market is not a charity. Investors don't care about your manufacturing; they only know that when the dollar's credit collapses, assets must run away quickly. The foreign exchange market was also closed today due to the Easter holiday in Australia, Hong Kong, and Europe, and liquidity was already thin, so the dollar's decline was magnified even more. Is Trump's &quot;devaluation-for-victory&quot; strategy a brilliant move or a blunder? Let's wait and see.</p>
<h4 id="how-much-further-can-the-dollar-fall">How Much Further Can the Dollar Fall?</h4>
<p>The dollar's decline is driven by emotions in the short term, policy games in the medium term, and may be a prelude to a credit crisis in the long term. If the Fed is really held in the White House's hands, how long can the dollar maintain its status as a reserve currency? Don't forget that global central banks still hold trillions of dollars in US bonds. Once confidence collapses, the selling wave will be no joke. I guess if the Dollar Index falls below 95, the international market will explode, and Trump will probably have to personally step in and shout &quot;stabilize.&quot;</p>

<h3 id="ii-gold-breaks-through-the-sky-bitcoin-flies-against-the-wind-is-a-new-safe-haven-pattern-coming">II. Gold &quot;Breaks Through the Sky,&quot; Bitcoin &quot;Flies Against the Wind,&quot; Is a New Safe-Haven Pattern Coming?</h3>
<h4 id="gold-4000-is-not-a-dream-cash-has-become-a-hot-potato">Gold: $4,000 Is Not a Dream, Cash Has Become a &quot;Hot Potato&quot;</h4>
<p>With the dollar plummeting, gold has naturally become a hot commodity. International gold prices hit a new historical high again today, and Wall Street investment banks are even calling for a target price of $4,000. Global central banks, institutions, and retail investors are hoarding gold for risk aversion. The days of cash being king are completely over—holding a pile of dollars and watching it shrink day by day, who wouldn't be nervous? I exchanged some euros for dollars a while ago, but now the exchange rate has jumped to 1.15, and I'm slapping my thighs in regret. Friends in the US may not feel it, since they earn and spend dollars, but for cross-currency players like me, it's a &quot;currency nightmare.&quot;</p>
<h4 id="bitcoin-the-counterattack-to-87000-a-new-safe-haven-king">Bitcoin: The &quot;Counterattack&quot; to $87,000, a New Safe-Haven King?</h4>
<p>Speaking of Bitcoin, it's simply the &quot;dark horse&quot; of this chaotic market. Logically speaking, a sharp drop in the dollar and a surge in the yen would drag down arbitrage trading, along with cryptocurrencies and tech stocks, just like the tragedy last August. But this time is different. Bitcoin withstood the pressure, breaking through $87,000 today, the largest single-day gain since the &quot;Tariff Liberation Day&quot; on April 2. Analysts guess that this is because gold has risen too wildly, and funds are overflowing to find new pools, so Bitcoin has become a &quot;safe-haven backup.&quot; What is the logic behind this? What the market fears is not recession, but stagflation—prices rise and currencies depreciate, and Bitcoin's anti-inflation attributes, like gold, have made it a new favorite of funds.</p>
<h4 id="stagflation-or-recession-what-is-the-market-betting-on">Stagflation or Recession, What Is the Market Betting On?</h4>
<p>I think this double rise in gold and Bitcoin reveals the market's deep anxiety. During a recession, everyone buys gold and US bonds for risk aversion, and risky assets like Bitcoin will cool down; but during stagflation, fiat currencies depreciate, and gold and Bitcoin become hard currencies. Now the yield on US bonds is hovering around 4%-4.5%, not far from the Fed's &quot;warning line&quot; of 4.8%. If it really soars to 5%, the Fed will probably have to resort to interest rate cuts + QE. At that time, will Bitcoin replace US bonds and become a new safe-haven asset? I boldly predict that if the dollar's credit collapses again, Bitcoin breaking $100,000 is not a dream.</p>

<h3 id="iii-tariff-negotiations-change-faces-faster-than-flipping-a-book-and-the-markets-optimistic-bubble-bursts">III. Tariff Negotiations &quot;Change Faces Faster Than Flipping a Book,&quot; and the Market's Optimistic Bubble Bursts</h3>
<h4 id="us-japan-and-us-europe-negotiations-stall-japanese-prime-minister-stands-tough-against-trump">US-Japan and US-Europe Negotiations Stall, Japanese Prime Minister Stands Tough Against Trump</h4>
<p>Tariffs are truly &quot;changing faces faster than flipping a book.&quot; Japanese negotiator Ryo Akazawa said not to expect a deal with the US in the short term. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba also stated in the parliament that he would never easily give in and national interests cannot be lost. There is no good news from Europe either, and US-EU negotiations are also stalled. Trump listed eight major crimes of Japan and the EU on Twitter over the weekend, such as exchange rate manipulation, dumping subsidies, and intellectual property theft, each of which seemed like a &quot;declaration of war.&quot; Last week, he said that negotiations were making progress, but this week he changed his face, and the market's optimism instantly became a soap bubble—&quot;pop,&quot; it's gone.</p>
<h4 id="the-tariff-war-is-a-protracted-war-dont-expect-a-quick-victory">The Tariff War Is a Protracted War, Don't Expect a Quick Victory</h4>
<p>Trump's operation is clearly one of extreme pressure, trying to force the other party to take over low-interest US bonds. But Japan and the EU are not easy to deal with either, and they would rather drag it out than compromise. I don't think these tariff negotiations will succeed in the short term, and the market must be prepared—uncertainty is the norm. Investors should not expect any &quot;stage results.&quot; Trump's tweets change three times a day, as unreliable as the weather forecast.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="iv-us-stock-market-technical-analysis-battle-to-defend-5000-points-shorts-laugh">IV. US Stock Market Technical Analysis: Battle to Defend 5000 Points, Shorts Laugh</h3>
<h4 id="sp-500-breaks-below-10-day-line-rebound-dream-shattered">S&amp;P 500 Breaks Below 10-Day Line, Rebound Dream Shattered</h4>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 opened sharply lower today, directly breaking through the 10-day moving average. The rebound on April 9 is officially over. The next target? A second test of the 5000-point bottom. The news was actually quite calm today, and the decline was mainly due to buyers running away, and the shorts didn't exert much force. The index has been falling sharply for several days, similar to the wave after the &quot;Tariff Liberation Day&quot; on April 2, but not as fierce, leaving two small gaps. Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett called for continuing to sell on rallies in the second quarter until the Fed cuts interest rates or there is a breakthrough in tariffs, otherwise, just stay honestly hovering between 5000-5500 points.</p>
<h4 id="retail-investors-bearish-sentiment-hits-record-high-where-is-the-market-bottom">Retail Investors' Bearish Sentiment Hits Record High, Where Is the Market Bottom?</h4>
<p>AAII data shows that retail investors' bearish sentiment has exceeded 50% for 8 consecutive weeks, setting a new historical record. What does this mean? Ordinary investors have been frightened out of their wits and have no intention of bottom-fishing. I think this wave of decline has not reached the most desperate time. To really see the bottom, you probably have to wait for the tech giants' earnings reports to all explode, or the Fed to release a big move. Can 5000 points be defended? I think it's unlikely.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="v-individual-stocks-and-sectors-in-widespread-mourning-tech-giants-cant-hold-on-either">V. Individual Stocks and Sectors in &quot;Widespread Mourning,&quot; Tech Giants Can't Hold On Either</h3>
<h4 id="tesla-affordable-car-delayed-again-musk-is-busy-making-a-mess">Tesla: Affordable Car Delayed Again, Musk Is Busy &quot;Making a Mess&quot;</h4>
<p>Tesla will release its Q1 earnings report after the market closes tomorrow, and institutions are generally bearish. It is said that the affordable model has been delayed again, from the first half of the year to the end of the year or even next year, and old shareholders are probably numb. Wedbush's bull Dan Ives couldn't help but complain that Musk's political alignment has made the brand a mess, and he should quickly return to business as usual. But Musk probably doesn't care at all, and the stock price will continue to suffer.</p>
<h4 id="nvidia-ai-fever-cools-down-100-level-lost">Nvidia: AI Fever Cools Down, $100 Level Lost</h4>
<p>AI leader Nvidia is even worse, with its stock price competing with Tesla every day to see who falls harder. It broke through $100 as soon as the market opened today. Microsoft and Amazon have also successively suspended data center leasing, and the market is worried that AI spending will shrink. Although the P/E ratio of 22 times is reasonable, the stock price still has to lie down for a while due to short-term valuation and performance cuts. Analysts who called for $170 and $200 at the beginning of the year are probably turning green now.</p>
<h4 id="intel-new-ceos-debut-chinese-market-becomes-a-hidden-danger">Intel: New CEO's Debut, Chinese Market Becomes a Hidden Danger</h4>
<p>Intel will release its earnings report on Thursday, which is the first show after the new CEO took office. Q1 revenue is expected to decline sequentially, and profits will barely break even. Investors are more concerned about the impact of tariffs on Chinese business. China accounts for 29% of Intel's revenue. If it really suffers from 84% retaliatory tariffs, AMD and Qualcomm will probably be laughing.</p>
<h4 id="is-there-still-hope-for-tech-stocks">Is There Still Hope for Tech Stocks?</h4>
<p>This collective silence of tech giants shows that the market is completely disappointed with growth expectations. Tesla and Nvidia will have a hard time turning around in the short term, and whether Intel can reverse the situation with its new CEO is also questionable. I think that for tech stocks to rise, we have to wait for a big AI project to land, or for the tariff uncertainty to be resolved, otherwise, they will continue to &quot;fall and fall.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="vi-china-us-trade-war-escalates-chinese-stocks-enveloped-in-delisting-clouds">VI. China-US Trade War Escalates, Chinese Stocks Enveloped in &quot;Delisting Clouds&quot;</h3>
<h4 id="financial-decoupling-risk-increases-800-billion-in-assets-in-jeopardy">Financial Decoupling Risk Increases, $800 Billion in Assets in Jeopardy</h4>
<p>The China-US trade war has not stopped, and US Treasury Secretary Besant has made harsh remarks that if Beijing does not give in, Chinese stocks may be kicked out of the US stock market. Goldman Sachs has calculated that if financial decoupling really happens, US investors will have to dump $800 billion in Chinese stocks, and China will also have to dump $1.7 trillion in US assets. Most Chinese stock KOLs have returned to Hong Kong stocks, but small-cap companies are miserable, with a market value of 300 billion Hong Kong dollars hanging in the air.</p>
<h4 id="do-chinese-stocks-have-a-future">Do Chinese Stocks Have a Future?</h4>
<p>I think that Chinese stocks are desensitized to tariff numbers in the short term, but in the long term, the sword of financial decoupling is always hanging high. Investors should be careful and not just stare at the stock price, but also think about exit strategies in extreme situations.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="conclusion-survival-in-chaos-investors-self-help-guide">Conclusion: Survival in Chaos, Investor's &quot;Self-Help Guide&quot;</h3>
<p>This market is truly &quot;chaotic to the extreme.&quot; The dollar is plummeting, gold is soaring, Bitcoin is counterattacking, tech stocks are crashing, tariff negotiations are failing... Investors must open their eyes wide and stare at US bond yields, Fed movements, and Trump's tweets. Suggestions? Diversify assets and don't put all your eggs in one basket. To survive in chaos, cash is not as good as gold, and technology is not as good as patience.</p>
