<h3 id="11-a-stock-price-surge-the-awakening-of-retail-investors-and-a-capital-carnival">1.1 A Stock Price Surge: The Awakening of Retail Investors and a Capital Carnival</h3>
<p>Just a year ago, Xiaomi’s shares were languishing around “HK$20 bargain-bin” levels, barely noticed by anyone. Today, they’ve transformed into “HK$50 prime-time” stocks, propelling the company’s market value toward the trillion-dollar club. This dramatic shift begs the question: <strong>Will Xiaomi’s cars take flight, or is it just the boundless imagination of retail investors at work?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The HK$20 Era:</strong> Retail investors barely gave Xiaomi a second glance—as if it were just another company selling phone cases.</li>
<li><strong>The HK$50 Era:</strong> Suddenly, these same investors discovered, “Hey, this car actually has four wheels!” and rushed to buy in, fearing they might miss out on the “next Tesla.”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="12-the-sales-secret-a-300000-vehicle-target-is-it-all-talk-or-a-sweet-deal">1.2 The Sales Secret: A 300,000-Vehicle Target – Is It All Talk or a Sweet Deal?</h3>
<p>Xiaomi has boldly declared a target of selling 300,000 cars by 2025, and the first two months have already shown “20,000+ units per month.” On the surface, the yearly goal appears to be a piece of cake. Yet, on closer inspection:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>From 135,000 to 300,000:</strong> What will drive such a doubling in sales? Is it a dramatic expansion in production capacity, or are consumers collectively suffering from a “Xiaomi faith syndrome”?</li>
<li><strong>The SU7 Pricing Puzzle:</strong> With prices ranging between HK$210,000 and HK$290,000, the midpoint of HK$250,000 seems like a math teacher’s dream. However, with Tesla cutting prices next door and BYD causing a stir, is Xiaomi positioning itself as a high-end brand or merely exuding an inexplicable confidence?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ii-the-price-to-earnings-rumble-tesla-volkswagen-li-auto-whos-the-real-valuation-powerhouse">II. The Price-to-Earnings Rumble: Tesla, Volkswagen, Li Auto – Who’s the Real Valuation Powerhouse?</h2>
<h3 id="21-measuring-up-to-tesla-where-does-a-128x-pe-ratios-money-making-power-come-from">2.1 Measuring Up to Tesla: Where Does a 128x PE Ratio’s “Money-Making Power” Come From?</h3>
<p>Using Tesla’s valuation logic, Xiaomi’s automotive business could be worth as much as HK$500 billion. Yet, this comparison raises a burning question: <strong>Tesla’s PE is based on tech stock expectations—could Xiaomi’s PE be nothing more than a “PowerPoint stock”?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tesla’s Magic Formula:</strong> Selling cars is just a side hustle; it’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) that really prints money, boasting software margins as high as 70%. Hardware? It’s merely there as a friendly accessory!</li>
<li><strong>Xiaomi’s Imitation Game:</strong> CEO Lei Jun claims that hardware margins will not exceed 5%, as the company attempts to mimic Tesla’s software-driven profits. But there’s a catch—Xiaomi’s autonomous driving is still in its “learner’s permit” phase. Would consumers really pay for a technology that’s still in driving-school mode?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="22-volkswagen-vs-li-auto-tortoise-like-pes-for-traditional-automakers-versus-roller-coaster-valuations-for-new-players">2.2 Volkswagen vs. Li Auto: “Tortoise-Like” PEs for Traditional Automakers Versus “Roller-Coaster Valuations” for New Players</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Volkswagen: The “Old Hand” with a 5x PE:</strong> With a market share as steady as a mountain, its growth is slower than Beijing’s third ring road at rush hour. The capital market’s valuation is akin to giving a pensioner a token bonus—just a modest nod.</li>
<li><strong>Li Auto: The “New Money” with a 22x PE:</strong> Although its sales are booming, the market whispers, “Is your extended-range system a breakthrough or just a quick fix exploiting policy loopholes?”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="23-xiaomis-valuation-conundrum-hk500-billion-or-hk20-billion-it-all-depends-on-whether-the-market-believes-the-hype">2.3 Xiaomi’s Valuation Conundrum: HK$500 Billion or HK$20 Billion? It All Depends on Whether the Market Believes the Hype</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>If Compared to Tesla:</strong> A profit of HK$3.75 billion multiplied by a 128x PE equals HK$480 billion, prompting retail investors to cheer, “Xiaomi is destined to be the Eastern Tesla!”</li>
<li><strong>If Compared to Volkswagen:</strong> HK$3.75 billion times a 5x PE equals HK$19 billion, leaving shareholders figuratively free-falling from a rooftop.</li>
<li><strong>The Only Truth:</strong> Valuation is never just a math problem—it’s a game of “Mafia” in the capital markets. Reveal your hand too soon, and you might just get cut down.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="31-a-5-hardware-margin-a-promise-of-integrity-or-a-business-trap">3.1 A 5% Hardware Margin: A Promise of Integrity or a Business Trap?</h3>
<p>When Lei Jun promises that hardware margins won’t exceed 5%, it sounds as if he’s saying, “We won’t make big money off you—we’re just here for the fun.” But a deeper look reveals:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Old Mobile Phone Trick:</strong> Xiaomi’s phones have long hovered below a 5% margin, yet they rake in billions annually from advertising and an ecosystem of services. Could its car business simply be “Phone 2.0”?</li>
<li><strong>A Word of Caution:</strong> If the software side fails to turn a profit while hardware struggles, Xiaomi’s automotive venture could become nothing more than a “charity car project.”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="32-software-monetization-the-pie-in-the-sky-approach-of-autonomous-driving">3.2 Software Monetization: The “Pie-in-the-Sky” Approach of Autonomous Driving</h3>
<p>Tesla rakes in tens of billions annually from its FSD, and Xiaomi hopes to snag a slice of that pie. However, the reality is stark:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A Technological Gap:</strong> Tesla’s autonomous driving mileage outstrips Xiaomi’s by a factor of 100—like comparing a PhD thesis to a primary school essay.</li>
<li><strong>Consumer Perception:</strong> While consumers are willing to pay for Elon Musk’s “Mars dream,” will they open their wallets for Lei Jun’s “value-for-money autonomous driving”?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="41-the-ecosystem-bet-mobile-phones-cars-aiot-a-closed-loop-or-a-dead-end">4.1 The Ecosystem Bet: Mobile Phones + Cars + AIoT – A Closed Loop or a Dead End?</h3>
<p>Xiaomi’s ace in the hole is its “ecosystem synergy,” yet a car isn’t a smart bracelet. When buying a vehicle, do consumers really expect it to seamlessly sync with their Xiaomi air conditioners?</p>
<h3 id="42-the-value-proposition-dilemma-the-impossible-triangle-of-high-end-positioning">4.2 The Value Proposition Dilemma: The Impossible Triangle of High-End Positioning</h3>
<p>The Xiaomi SU7 is priced at HK$250,000—it must pack premium components (think CATL batteries and NVIDIA chips), maintain a ≤5% profit margin, and still deliver a high-end image. It’s like expecting one person to be Einstein, Steve Jobs, and a top-tier influencer all at once.</p>
<h3 id="43-the-unwritten-rules-of-capital-games-valuation-value-belief-bubble">4.3 The Unwritten Rules of Capital Games: Valuation ≠ Value, Belief ≈ Bubble</h3>
<p>Tesla’s lofty PE is built on expectations of disrupting traditional industries, while Xiaomi’s current narrative resembles a “Chinese imitation of Tesla.” When market patience runs out, a trillion-dollar valuation might quickly evaporate into mere paper value.</p>

<h2 id="v-a-survival-guide-for-retail-investors-is-xiaomi-car-a-bet-it-all-opportunity">V. A Survival Guide for Retail Investors: Is Xiaomi Car a “Bet It All” Opportunity?</h2>
<h3 id="51-the-optimists-xiaomi-as-the-next-tesla-missing-out-now-could-mean-losing-out-on-ten-bitcoins">5.1 The Optimists: Xiaomi as the Next Tesla – Missing Out Now Could Mean Losing Out on Ten Bitcoins</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Logic:</strong> China’s supply chain advantage + a loyal base of “Mi fans” + Lei Jun’s hardworking aura = an unbeatable combination.</li>
<li><strong>The Risk:</strong> Should Tesla suddenly slash prices to HK$200,000, the Xiaomi SU7 might just end up as the “best runner-up of the year.”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="52-the-pessimists-a-trillion-dollar-valuation-is-a-bubble-and-xiaomis-car-is-headed-for-a-crash">5.2 The Pessimists: A Trillion-Dollar Valuation is a Bubble, and Xiaomi’s Car Is Headed for a Crash</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Logic:</strong> With a 90% failure rate among new automakers and Xiaomi lacking core technology, its valuation relies entirely on “imaginative PowerPoint presentations.”</li>
<li><strong>The Wry Comment:</strong> “I used to think Jia Yueting was a scammer; now it seems he just started ten years too early.”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="53-the-realists-in-the-short-term-its-all-about-sentiment-in-the-long-run-its-about-technology">5.3 The Realists: In the Short Term, It’s All About Sentiment; In the Long Run, It’s About Technology</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Verdict:</strong> If you believe Xiaomi can crack the code on autonomous driving and build a robust software ecosystem, now might be the time to buy the dip. But if you’re only in it for a gamble, you might as well go seek a fortune teller’s advice.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="vi-in-conclusion-is-xiaomis-trillion-dollar-gamble-a-myth-or-a-farce">VI. In Conclusion: Is Xiaomi’s Trillion-Dollar Gamble a Myth or a Farce?</h2>
<p>The capital markets are never short on stories—they only lack the people who can make those stories a reality. Xiaomi’s valuation frenzy is, at its core, a capital game of “belief or disbelief.” When the tide recedes, one thing will be clear:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tesla’s moat</strong> is built on technological dominance,</li>
<li><strong>Xiaomi’s moat</strong> might just be Lei Jun’s uncanny PowerPoint prowess.</li>
</ul>
<p>And as for the retail investors? Remember this hard truth: <strong>The moment you start believing “this time it’s different,” the reaper’s already raised his scythe.</strong></p>
