                <h2 id="1-introduction-the-turbulence-of-triple-witching">1. Introduction: The Turbulence of &quot;Triple Witching&quot;</h2>
<p>The financial markets are never a sanctuary of warmth and charity—they are a cold-blooded slaughterhouse. On Friday, March 21, a &quot;Triple Witching&quot; day, short sellers descended like starving wolves on their prey. Riding on the pessimistic outlook of industry leaders and two major negative catalysts, they slammed the S&amp;P 500 down to 5603 points in early trading. Rumors of a second large-scale round of federal layoffs emanated from the White House, with tens of thousands of federal jobs hanging in the balance; meanwhile, a top Fed official, Williams, ominously warned of &quot;slowing growth coupled with rising inflation—a double-edged risk,&quot; igniting widespread market panic. However, the bulls were not idle. They mounted a counteroffensive after midday, with tech giants driving a recovery by pushing the index from negative territory back to positive territory, ultimately closing with a modest gain. On the surface, the bulls had reclaimed a battle, but the deeper undercurrents of this confrontation were just beginning to emerge.</p>

<h2 id="2-market-analysis-index-illusions-and-stock-carnage">2. Market Analysis: Index Illusions and Stock Carnage</h2>
<h3 id="21-the-reality-behind-the-divergence-index-gains-amid-stock-bloodbaths">2.1 The Reality Behind the Divergence: Index Gains Amid Stock Bloodbaths</h3>
<p>Do not be fooled by the red tape on the index. While the S&amp;P 500 ended higher, most stocks were hemorrhaging—a divergence reminiscent of a wolf in sheep's clothing. High-frequency data revealed that less than 40% of stocks registered gains that day, with tech giants propping up the appearance of a rally while mid- and small-cap stocks suffered devastating losses. This was not a genuine rebound but an illusion—a few heavyweights disguising the broader market's turmoil.</p>
<h3 id="22-valuation-bubbles-whos-naked-when-the-tide-recedes">2.2 Valuation Bubbles: Who’s Naked When the Tide Recedes?</h3>
<p>This correction has wiped out several valuation bubbles. The S&amp;P 500’s forward P/E ratio fell from 22 times at the start of the year to 19 times, though still above the 5-year average of 18 times and the 10-year average of 17 times. Cheap? Don’t be fooled. Compared to historical bottoms below 15 times, today’s valuations remain far from bargain levels. Goldman Sachs has signaled a bottom, yet CTA positions have been whittled down, and the bulls’ ammunition appears exhausted. What, then, is there to fuel a genuine rebound? Mere faith?</p>
<h3 id="23-underlying-capital-salvation-or-trap-in-april">2.3 Underlying Capital: Salvation or Trap in April?</h3>
<p>As selling pressure eased, CTA exposure to the S&amp;P 500 fell to its lowest level of 2023, seemingly prompting short sellers to lower their guard. In April, a staggering $32 billion in pension funds is expected to flow into equities—a level not seen since the 93rd percentile of 2000. Goldman Sachs forecasts a bottoming out and rebound, but let’s not forget: for capital to flow back, the market must first stabilize. Currently, the market resembles a gravely injured fighter—able to catch its breath but still far from secure.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="3-technical-insights-the-crucial-battle-between-bulls-and-bears">3. Technical Insights: The Crucial Battle Between Bulls and Bears</h2>
<h3 id="31-nasdaq-100-a-doji-amid-the-battle">3.1 Nasdaq 100: A Doji Amid the Battle</h3>
<p>The Nasdaq 100’s weekly candlestick closed up 0.25%—a small bullish candle resembling a doji, highlighting an indecisive tug-of-war between bulls and bears. Although today's naked bullish candle appeared strong on the daily chart, it was still struggling below its 250-day moving average. Breaking above 20,000 points is critical; otherwise, this rally might merely be a dead cat bounce. Trend-following CTAs are on high alert—if buying pressure cannot be sustained, short sellers could quickly regain control.</p>
<h3 id="32-support-and-resistance-the-battle-at-5600-points">3.2 Support and Resistance: The Battle at 5600 Points</h3>
<p>In early trading, the S&amp;P 500 fell below 5600 points, nearly triggering a collapse at the 5565 strike price in the options market. However, the index held on, with the 5-day moving average acting as the last defensive line for the bulls, allowing the market to close above it—providing a faint glimmer of hope for next week. Yet, with 5700 points acting as a ceiling and the intraday high reaching only 5670, profit-taking by those holding protective puts reaped handsome gains for the bears. Technically, while the bulls have defended their position, their offensive remains lackluster.</p>
<h3 id="33-trend-outlook-a-rebound-or-a-lure-for-the-greedy">3.3 Trend Outlook: A Rebound or a Lure for the Greedy?</h3>
<p>The VIX slipped below 20, signaling a rebound in risk appetite, but the apparent stability is merely a facade. Without a sustained influx of capital, both the 20,000-point and 5700-point levels are just fat targets for short sellers. CTAs chasing a rising market might temporarily push the index higher, but if volatility returns, the rebound could prove to be nothing more than a lure, setting the stage for further declines. Technical signals remain ambiguous, leaving investors to sharpen their wits and make their own judgments.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="4-the-macro-conspiracy-a-dual-act-by-the-fed-and-the-government">4. The Macro Conspiracy: A Dual Act by the Fed and the Government</h2>
<h3 id="41-fed-feuding-walkers-all-in-stand">4.1 Fed Feuding: Walker’s All-In Stand</h3>
<p>Fed Governor Walker defended his lone dissenting vote by emphasizing that banks had ample reserves, and there was no need to slow the pace of U.S. Treasury sales. Data indicated that reserve balances had exceeded $3 trillion, and overnight reverse repurchase agreements along with the Treasury General Account had plunged, suggesting a theoretically loose liquidity environment. Yet, why aren’t stocks rallying? The liquidity has not flowed into the equity market; instead, the government has been channeling it into the bond market.</p>
<h3 id="42-the-liquidity-ruse-the-hidden-weapon-of-the-tga">4.2 The Liquidity Ruse: The Hidden Weapon of the TGA</h3>
<p>The TGA balance shrank from 828.1 billion in February to 435.9 billion—nearly halved—releasing funds that drove down 2-year Treasury yields and the U.S. dollar index. In theory, an expansion of interbank credit should benefit the stock market, but the reality has been far harsher. The government’s objective is not to rescue the market but to push 10-year Treasury yields below 4%, creating panic and forcing capital into bonds. The stock market’s decline appears controlled—a systematic bloodletting rather than a chaotic collapse.</p>
<h3 id="43-policy-warfare-stocks-as-the-sacrificial-lambs">4.3 Policy Warfare: Stocks as the Sacrificial Lambs</h3>
<p>With 10-year Treasury yields stubbornly clinging to 4.2%, the government’s master plan has yet to materialize. The stock market’s decline has been insufficient to trigger widespread panic, and capital has not flowed massively into bonds. This adjustment is not a spontaneous market correction—it is a case of “targeted suppression.” A short-term rebound might occur, but as long as the bond market’s objectives remain unmet, stocks will continue to take the hit. Do not expect a rescue from the Fed; they are too busy performing their double act.</p>

<h3 id="51-the-dual-battle-in-defense-boeings-comeback-vs-lmts-plunge">5.1 The Dual Battle in Defense: Boeing’s Comeback vs. LMT’s Plunge</h3>
<p>In the defense sector, Lockheed Martin (LMT) lost a $20 billion F-47 contract, causing its stock to plunge back to levels from a month ago, with prices nearing $400. In stark contrast, Boeing surged, buoyed by a multi-hundred-million-dollar deal under the Trump administration—a move that could potentially reverse its downward trend. With LMT’s fundamentals still intact, investors might find buying opportunities on dips, while Boeing’s stock, if it reaches $220, could offer a 20% upside.</p>
<h3 id="52-consumer-and-tech-nikes-collapse-microns-misfire">5.2 Consumer and Tech: Nike’s Collapse, Micron’s Misfire</h3>
<p>Nike’s earnings report painted a bleak picture—weak performance, failed restructuring, and mounting tariff pressures led to a 15% drop in Q4 sales and further erosion of gross margins, forcing its stock into a downward spiral with recovery nowhere in sight. Meanwhile, Micron’s earnings, though exceeding expectations, were followed by an 8% decline as profit-taking ensued amid market uncertainty. Despite solid fundamentals, short-term traders fled, and a profitable turnaround in DRAM may not materialize until 2026. In this environment, sentiment proves more ruthless than fundamentals.</p>
<h3 id="53-teslas-uncertainty-elon-musks-bold-gamble">5.3 Tesla’s Uncertainty: Elon Musk’s Bold Gamble</h3>
<p>Tesla led the S&amp;P 500 rally, with its daily chart holding above both the 5-day and 10-day moving averages. Musk’s call for 5,000 humanoid robots hints at a potential short-term rebound. However, weak EV sales and a pivot toward robotics appear to be long-term distractions. With escalating U.S.-China political risks, retail investors have funneled a record $8 billion into the stock over 13 days, temporarily supporting the price. In the short run, shares might climb to between $285 and $300, yet the long-term outlook remains a bet on Musk’s audacity.</p>
<h3 id="54-nvidia-and-nio-cooling-ai-hype-and-the-decline-of-chinese-stocks">5.4 NVIDIA and NIO: Cooling AI Hype and the Decline of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>At the NVIDIA GTC conference, there were few surprises. With the only highlight being a $40.6 billion share buyback, investors now wait for the next earnings report to gauge performance beyond the current $150 level. NIO, despite achieving record Q4 deliveries, suffered a staggering $6.6 billion loss, dragging its share price down to between $4 and $5, rendering it one of the worst-performing Chinese stocks. As the AI fervor cools and competition in the EV sector intensifies, only the strongest will survive while the weaker players fall by the wayside.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="6-market-sentiment-and-behavior-the-faith-of-retail-investors-versus-institutional-calculations">6. Market Sentiment and Behavior: The Faith of Retail Investors Versus Institutional Calculations</h2>
<h3 id="61-retail-fervor-teslas-stubborn-bullishness">6.1 Retail Fervor: Tesla’s Stubborn Bullishness</h3>
<p>Despite Tesla’s share price being slashed in half, retail investors managed to net buy $8 billion over 13 days—the highest level since 2015. These fervent believers ignore traditional valuation metrics, placing unwavering faith solely in Musk, and in doing so, they artificially support the stock price. While this infuses a short-term boost into the market, the long-term risks remain substantial.</p>
<h3 id="62-institutional-strategies-ctas-lying-in-wait">6.2 Institutional Strategies: CTAs Lying in Wait</h3>
<p>CTAs have largely stepped back, with the VIX falling below 20 and risk appetite momentarily reviving. However, institutions are cautious. If the Nasdaq breaches 20,000 points, they might join the rally; if the market becomes volatile, they will resume their familiar practice of reaping gains from retail losses. The classic scenario unfolds: retail investors rush forward while institutions collect the profits.</p>
<h3 id="63-market-psychology-the-lingering-shadows-of-fear-and-greed">6.3 Market Psychology: The Lingering Shadows of Fear and Greed</h3>
<p>Though the VIX has dipped below 20, suggesting cautious optimism, the underlying panic has not subsided and greed has yet to take hold. With stock performance diverging sharply and the index’s gains proving illusory, investor confidence remains volatile. Government policies aimed at suppressing bond yields continue to weigh on equities, making the psychological battle as crucial as the technical one.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="7-conclusion-the-battle-rages-on-yet-opportunities-lurk-in-the-shadows">7. Conclusion: The Battle Rages On, Yet Opportunities Lurk in the Shadows</h2>
<p>In this market slaughterhouse, short sellers encircle their prey while bulls fight back, leaving a trail of bloodshed. The technical indicators are ambiguous, the macroeconomic strategies shrouded in conspiracies, and individual stocks vary dramatically in their fortunes. A short-term rebound might be on the horizon, but as long as the bond market’s targets remain unmet, the downturn is unlikely to be fully arrested. For investors seeking survival in this ruthless arena, the message is clear: be vigilant and discerning—pounce on dips in stocks like Boeing and Tesla, stand ready to capture gains in stalwart players like LMT and NVIDIA, and keep a cautious distance from troubled names like Nike and NIO.</p>
