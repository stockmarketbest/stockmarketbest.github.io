<h3 id="1-the-logical-trap-behind-the-sp-500s-six-day-winning-streak">(1) The Logical Trap Behind the S&amp;P 500's Six-Day Winning Streak</h3>
<p><strong>Data and Appearance:</strong><br>
On April 29, 2025, the three major U.S. stock indexes collectively closed higher, with the S&amp;P 500 index rising for six consecutive trading days and successfully filling the gap left on March 18 (the date of the tariff policy announcement). From a technical perspective, the index not only returned to the level before the &quot;Tariff Liberation Day&quot; but also recovered half of its losses since the beginning of the year. On the surface, this seems to validate Wall Street's acceptance of the Trump administration's economic narrative—that through a series of tax cuts, infrastructure investments, and technology support policies, the U.S. stock market is returning to a bull market trajectory.</p>
<p><strong>Internal Logic Contradictions:</strong><br>
However, this rise is not based on improved fundamentals but stems from the early realization of market expectations and the short-term stimulus effects under political manipulation. The White House's large-scale &quot;Invest in America&quot; event on May 1 is attracting executives from tech giants such as Nvidia and SoftBank, as well as Trump himself, to take the stage, with expectations of announcing tens of billions of dollars in investment plans. While such political showmanship boosts market sentiment in the short term, its essence is typical &quot;expectation management&quot; rather than a genuine shift in economic momentum. More crucially, the Federal Reserve's rate cut cycle has not yet begun, and inflationary pressures persist, making it difficult for this short-term optimism to sustain a long-term upward trend.</p>
<h3 id="2-earnings-season-and-collective-risk-warnings-for-tech-stocks">(2) Earnings Season and Collective Risk Warnings for Tech Stocks</h3>
<p><strong>Earnings Dilemmas of Tech Giants:</strong><br>
Despite the seemingly strong overall market, the core technology sector is showing signs of fatigue. Nvidia, the leading AI chip company, reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of only $0.31 for the third quarter, far below analysts' expectations of $0.53. This directly led to a 2% drop in its stock price and dragged down the entire data center concept industry chain. At the same time, SOFI, despite doubling its Q1 net profit year-on-year to $71.45 million, saw its stock price surge by 9.5% after the earnings release but quickly fall back, erasing almost all of its intraday gains—indicating that the market has begun to be wary of the &quot;sell the news&quot; logic.</p>
<p><strong>QQQ's High-Level Risks and Signals of Capital Withdrawal:</strong><br>
The Nasdaq 100 Index ETF (QQQ) has shown clear signs of stagnation after touching the 50-day moving average. As the core bellwether for tech stocks, its current valuation level is close to the high point of the March rebound, with less than 4% of space above the resistance level. If it fails to break through this key resistance in the next few trading days, it is likely to fall into a medium-term correction trend. More importantly, recent capital flow data shows that retail investors are engaging in short-term speculation through leveraged ETFs (such as TQQQ), while institutional investors are gradually reducing their positions—this combination signal of &quot;longs reducing positions + shorts building positions&quot; indicates that the market is about to make a directional choice.</p>
<h3 id="3-the-feds-rate-cut-paradox-and-the-shadow-of-inflation">(3) The Fed's Rate Cut Paradox and the Shadow of Inflation</h3>
<p><strong>Policy Dilemma Under Stagflation Trap:</strong><br>
Despite the White House's push for the &quot;Made in America&quot; strategy, attempting to reshape the economic structure through infrastructure investment and tariff adjustments, current inflation data remains the biggest constraint on monetary policy. The latest data shows that the U.S. trade deficit in goods expanded to a record $162 billion in March, far exceeding the expected $145 billion. Behind this figure is the behavior of companies and consumers stocking up in advance to avoid the upcoming new round of tariffs. While this &quot;buying spree&quot; has boosted the prosperity of some industries in the short term, its essence is a pessimistic expectation of future economic prospects—if supply chain problems persist, inflationary pressures will be difficult to alleviate, forcing the Federal Reserve to continue maintaining a tight stance.</p>
<p><strong>Conflict Between Capital Flows and Market Narrative:</strong><br>
The current U.S. capital market is in a contradictory state—on the one hand, the White House is promoting the &quot;Invest in America&quot; narrative through political maneuvering, attempting to attract global capital inflows; on the other hand, the risk of stagflation in the real economy is constantly accumulating. This disconnect indicates that the stock market's rise is based more on expectations of policy dividends than on actual economic momentum. Once the market discovers that policy promises are out of sync with reality (such as tariff adjustments failing to effectively alleviate supply chain problems), it is very likely to trigger a capital exodus and systemic selling risks.</p>
<h2 id="ii-supply-chain-crisis-retail-dilemma-and-political-game-under-trade-war">II. Supply Chain Crisis: Retail Dilemma and Political Game Under Trade War</h2>
<h3 id="1-the-devastating-impact-of-tariff-policies-on-retailers">(1) The Devastating Impact of Tariff Policies on Retailers</h3>
<p><strong>Giants Like Walmart Forced to Bear Huge Costs:</strong><br>
After the &quot;Tariff Liberation Day&quot; on April 2, major U.S. retailers (such as Walmart, Home Depot, and Target) once strongly demanded that Chinese suppliers bear the costs of the new tariffs themselves. However, after 20 days of negotiations, these companies were ultimately forced to compromise due to inventory pressure—agreeing to bear the additional tariff costs. This decision directly led to a significant compression of their profit margins and may trigger a chain reaction. It is estimated that Walmart alone needs to pay for the new tariffs, and if it cannot transfer the costs to the consumer end, its annual profits may decrease by more than $19 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Supply Chain Disruption and Impact on People's Livelihood:</strong><br>
More seriously, more than 50% of U.S. imported goods come from China—especially labor-intensive products such as toys and clothing. Data from the Port of Los Angeles shows that the number of cargo ships departing from China decreased by 33% from April 2 to April 28, resulting in a nationwide supermarket shelf vacancy rate of up to 30%. This not only intensifies the competitive pressure in the retail industry but also directly threatens the living costs of ordinary consumers—if supply chain problems continue to deteriorate, soaring prices will become a real risk, further weakening the fundamental stability of the U.S. economy.</p>
<h3 id="2-the-white-houses-tariff-preference-game-and-voter-attitudes">(2) The White House's Tariff Preference Game and Voter Attitudes</h3>
<p><strong>Possible &quot;Amnesty&quot; for Essential Goods:</strong><br>
Faced with the dual pressure from retailers and consumers, it is widely speculated that the White House may have provided implicit tariff preferences to key industries (such as food and medicine). However, as of April 29, relevant policy details have not been officially announced—this ambiguity makes the market full of uncertainty about future policy directions. If the White House fails to take substantial measures, the retail industry's dilemma will intensify and may have a profound impact on the 2026 midterm elections and even the 2032 presidential election.</p>
<p><strong>Divergence in Attitudes of Swing State Voters:</strong><br>
According to Walmart CEO Doug McMillon's warning, if the supply of key commodities cannot be restored within two weeks, 59% of swing state voters in the United States may turn against Trump and his tariff policies due to soaring prices. This data shows that the current trade war is not only an economic issue but also a core battlefield for political games—the White House must find a balance between maintaining the &quot;Made in America&quot; narrative and alleviating the pressure on people's livelihood, otherwise its governing legitimacy will be seriously challenged.</p>
<h2 id="iii-collective-collapse-of-tech-stocks-risk-transmission-from-nvidia-to-sofi">III. Collective Collapse of Tech Stocks: Risk Transmission from Nvidia to SOFI</h2>
<h3 id="1-nvidias-earnings-crisis-and-industry-chain-impact">(1) Nvidia's Earnings Crisis and Industry Chain Impact</h3>
<p><strong>AI Chip Leader Encountering Performance Waterloo:</strong><br>
As the core provider of global AI computing power, Nvidia's earnings performance has always been a market bellwether. However, in Q3 2025 (fiscal third quarter), its adjusted earnings per share were only $0.31, far below analysts' expectations of $0.53—this data not only disappointed investors but also directly led to a collective decline in data center concept stocks. The AI computing power industry chain centered on Nvidia, including server manufacturers and cloud computing service providers, has been affected.</p>
<p><strong>After-Hours Decline and Reversal of Market Sentiment:</strong><br>
On the day after the earnings release (April 30), Nvidia's stock price fell by 2%, driving the Nasdaq 100 index to appear under pressure to correct. This performance indicates that although the prospects for AI technology are broad, the capital market has begun to be wary of the sustainability of corporate profitability—if core technology cannot be transformed into a stable source of income, the so-called &quot;AI revolution&quot; may just be hype.</p>
<h3 id="2-sofis-capital-withdrawal-phenomenon-under-positive-earnings">(2) SOFI's Capital Withdrawal Phenomenon Under Positive Earnings</h3>
<p><strong>Bright Performance But Abandoned by the Market:</strong><br>
Financial technology company SOFI performed well in its Q1 earnings report, with net profit reaching $71.45 million, doubling year-on-year. However, although the stock price once surged by 9.5% after the earnings release, it quickly fell back and almost erased its intraday gains—this &quot;sell the news&quot; phenomenon indicates that institutional investors have been laying out a retreat strategy in advance.</p>
<p><strong>Deep Logic Behind Capital Withdrawal:</strong><br>
The current market's concerns about the financial technology sector are not unfounded. Although SOFI's profit growth is significant, its core businesses (such as consumer loans and investment products) are still highly dependent on the macroeconomic environment. If the Federal Reserve maintains a high-interest rate policy, the profitability of such companies will be directly impacted—investors choosing to leave early is essentially a risk aversion behavior.</p>
<h3 id="3-potential-minefields-for-upst-and-hood">(3) Potential Minefields for UPST and HOOD</h3>
<p><strong>Capital Game Before UPST Earnings:</strong><br>
As another financial technology company (Upstart), its earnings date is scheduled for May 6. If the current stock price continues to rise, it is likely to repeat the SOFI scenario of &quot;sell the news&quot;; conversely, if a correction occurs before the earnings report, it may usher in a short-term rebound opportunity—but in any case, the high valuation risk of this sector cannot be ignored.</p>
<p><strong>HOOD's Trading Volume Trap:</strong><br>
Although trading platform Robinhood (HOOD) benefited from the increase in market volatility in the first quarter, its business model essentially still relies on the activity of high-frequency traders. If the market tends to be stable in the future, HOOD's revenue growth will face a ceiling—investors need to be wary of the logical reversal of &quot;good performance ≠ good stock price.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="iv-retail-dilemma-and-voter-attitudes-the-political-cost-of-the-trade-war">IV. Retail Dilemma and Voter Attitudes: The Political Cost of the Trade War</h2>
<h3 id="1-walmarts-supply-chain-crisis-and-profit-compression">(1) Walmart's Supply Chain Crisis and Profit Compression</h3>
<p><strong>Chain Reaction of Being Forced to Bear Tariff Costs:</strong><br>
After April 2, retailers such as Walmart originally required Chinese suppliers to bear the new tariffs themselves. However, in the case of tight inventories, these companies finally compromised—agreeing to pay the additional fees. Although this decision alleviated short-term supply pressure, it will seriously erode its profitability in the long run. It is estimated that Walmart alone may lose $19 billion in annual profit as a result.</p>
<p><strong>Stock Price Fluctuations and Market Confidence:</strong><br>
Affected by this, Walmart's stock price has been under pressure since the beginning of April and has not risen in sync with the broader market. This performance indicates that the capital market has begun to question the overall competitiveness of the retail industry—if it is impossible to pass on tariff costs to consumers, the company's profit model will be difficult to maintain.</p>
<h3 id="2-divergence-of-voter-attitudes-and-political-risks">(2) Divergence of Voter Attitudes and Political Risks</h3>
<p><strong>Sensitivity of Swing State Residents to Prices:</strong><br>
According to Walmart CEO Doug McMillon's warning, if the supply of key commodities cannot be restored within two weeks, 59% of swing state voters in the United States may turn against Trump and his tariff policies due to soaring prices. This data shows that the current trade war is not only an economic issue but also a core battlefield for political games—the White House must find a balance between maintaining the &quot;Made in America&quot; narrative and alleviating the pressure on people's livelihood, otherwise its governing legitimacy will be seriously challenged.</p>

<p><strong>Can the S&amp;P 500 Break Through?</strong><br>
The current S&amp;P 500 index has approached the 20-day moving average and faces technical pressure near 5800 points. If it cannot effectively break through in the next few trading days, a short-term correction trend is likely to occur. In addition, the Nasdaq 100 Index ETF (QQQ) is also in a high-level volatility state—if it falls below the 5-day moving average, it may trigger a medium-term adjustment risk.</p>
<h3 id="2-capital-flows-and-market-confidence">(2) Capital Flows and Market Confidence</h3>
<p><strong>Signals of Longs Reducing Positions + Shorts Building Positions:</strong><br>
Recent data shows that retail investors are engaging in short-term speculation through leveraged ETFs, while institutional investors are gradually reducing their positions. This combination signal of &quot;longs leaving the market + shorts entering the market&quot; indicates that the market is about to face a directional choice—if it fails to form new upward momentum, a capital exodus may occur in the short term.</p>
<h3 id="3-operation-strategies-and-risk-control">(3) Operation Strategies and Risk Control</h3>
<p><strong>Position Management and Profit Protection:</strong><br>
For investors holding TQQQ or option products, the most important thing at present is to be prepared to stop profits and stop losses. Even if there is a rebound stimulated by positive news in the next few trading days, it should be treated with caution—after all, once the market trend reverses, the previous profits may quickly evaporate.</p>
<h3 id="4-uncertainty-of-future-policy-direction">(4) Uncertainty of Future Policy Direction</h3>
<p><strong>Can the White House Continue to Promote the &quot;Invest in America&quot; Narrative?</strong><br>
Although the White House is attracting global capital inflows through the &quot;Invest in America&quot; campaign, the risk of stagflation in the current real economy is constantly accumulating. If supply chain problems persist and inflationary pressures continue to exist, the White House's economic narrative will be difficult to gain market recognition—at that time, the capital market may experience a short-term selling spree and have a profound impact on the overall economic environment.</p>

<h3 id="1-when-market-euphoria-meets-realitys-cracks">(1) When Market Euphoria Meets Reality's Cracks</h3>
<p>The current U.S. stock market is at a special turning point—on the one hand, market sentiment tends to be optimistic due to policy dividends; on the other hand, the risk of stagflation and supply chain problems in the real economy are constantly accumulating. This disconnect indicates that the market's short-term rise is based more on speculation on policy expectations than on the transformation of actual economic momentum.</p>
<h3 id="2-how-should-investors-respond-to-uncertainty">(2) How Should Investors Respond to Uncertainty?</h3>
<p>For ordinary investors, a cautious strategy should be adopted in the current environment—control positions, be prepared to stop profits and stop losses, and pay close attention to changes in market trends. If there are signs of capital withdrawal in the next few trading days, the investment portfolio needs to be adjusted in a timely manner to avoid systemic risks.</p>
<h3 id="3-the-game-between-policy-and-the-market-will-continue-to-be-staged">(3) The Game Between Policy and the Market Will Continue to Be Staged</h3>
<p>In the short term, the &quot;Invest in America&quot; campaign promoted by the White House may still provide some support for the market; but from a long-term perspective, if supply chain problems cannot be effectively alleviated and inflationary pressures persist, the overall performance of the market will be seriously affected. Investors need to keep a clear head and find a balance between policy dividends and economic fundamentals—only in this way can they take the initiative in future uncertainties.</p>
<h3 id="4-three-possible-paths-for-future-trends">(4) Three Possible Paths for Future Trends</h3>
<p><strong>Best Scenario:</strong> If the White House can effectively resolve the supply chain crisis and promote economic growth back on track, the market is expected to continue its current upward trend. However, this possibility is low because current policy tools are close to their limits.</p>
<p><strong>Intermediate Scenario:</strong> In the game between policy and market forces, the stock market may experience short-term fluctuations, but the overall trend remains stable—this is the most likely scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Worst Scenario:</strong> If supply chain problems persist and inflationary pressures continue to rise, the market will face systemic selling risks and may trigger a financial crisis. Although this path has a low probability, it still needs to be guarded against.</p>

<h3 id="1-warning-signals-of-the-tech-stock-bubble">(1) Warning Signals of the Tech Stock Bubble</h3>
<p>The current collective rise of the AI concept sector is essentially a &quot;narrative-driven&quot; investment behavior—investors buy related stocks based on optimistic expectations of future technology prospects. However, in the absence of substantial profit support, this hype is prone to forming a short-term bubble. If real commercial application scenarios cannot be realized in the next few months, AI concept stocks may face a significant correction risk.</p>
<h3 id="2-policy-choices-in-the-retail-dilemma">(2) Policy Choices in the Retail Dilemma</h3>
<p>Faced with the dual pressure from retailers and consumers, the White House needs to find a balance between &quot;protecting American manufacturing&quot; and alleviating the burden on people's livelihood—this process will directly affect the accumulation speed of its political capital. If substantial measures are not introduced in the short term, voter confidence may further deteriorate and pose a threat to future governing legitimacy.</p>
<h3 id="3-the-feds-monetary-policy-dilemma">(3) The Fed's Monetary Policy Dilemma</h3>
<p>Current inflationary pressures still exist, and supply chain problems make the economic outlook full of uncertainty—in this context, the Fed's rate cut decision becomes extremely difficult. If monetary policy is relaxed too early, it may exacerbate inflation; but if it continues to maintain a tight stance, market liquidity risk will further increase. This dilemma will be one of the core variables affecting the stock market trend in the next few months.</p>
<h3 id="4-long-term-challenges-of-global-supply-chain-restructuring">(4) Long-Term Challenges of Global Supply Chain Restructuring</h3>
<p>The United States is trying to reshape the global supply chain structure through tariff adjustments and industrial repatriation policies, but the realization of this goal is extremely difficult—although countries such as Vietnam and India have gradually taken over some orders, they are still difficult to replace Chinese manufacturing in terms of quality control and production capacity scale. If effective solutions cannot be found in the next few years, the global trading system will face long-term structural changes.</p>
<h3 id="5-investors-psychological-game-and-market-cycle">(5) Investors' Psychological Game and Market Cycle</h3>
<p>The current market is in a special psychological stage—on the one hand, investors are full of expectations for policy dividends; on the other hand, they are worried about the uncertainty of economic fundamentals. This contradictory mentality makes market sentiment easily affected by external news and may lead to violent fluctuations in the short term. For ordinary investors, it is crucial to maintain rational judgment and avoid blindly following the trend in this environment.</p>
<h3 id="6-core-variables-of-the-future-market">(6) Core Variables of the Future Market</h3>
<p>In the next few months, the following factors will be key to influencing the stock market trend:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Can supply chain problems be effectively alleviated?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Will the Federal Reserve restart the rate cut cycle?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Can the tech stock sector maintain its current upward trend?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Can the White House's economic narrative gain market recognition?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>These variables not only determine the performance of the short-term market but will also profoundly affect the future direction of the entire U.S. economic system.</p>
