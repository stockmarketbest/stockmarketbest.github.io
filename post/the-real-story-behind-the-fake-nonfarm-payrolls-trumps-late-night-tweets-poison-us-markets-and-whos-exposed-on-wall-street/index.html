<h4 id="11-employment-data-plays-a-russian-doll-game">1.1 Employment Data Plays a “Russian Doll” Game</h4>
<p>The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics delivered a dramatic data makeover this week. February’s nonfarm payrolls came in at 151,000 jobs added—ostensibly debunking Bloomberg’s grim forecast of 65,000—while concealing three hidden twists. The previous reading was cut from 143,000 to 125,000, the unemployment rate ticked up from 4.0% to 4.1%, and hourly wage growth was technically revised down to 3.9%. This maneuver, as deceptive as a social media filter that makes everything look flawless on screen, left Wall Street analysts wondering if the data team was following a script planted by Trump himself.</p>
<h4 id="12-the-feds-schrödinger-rate-cut">1.2 The Fed’s “Schrödinger Rate Cut”</h4>
<p>Chairman Powell delivered a textbook performance of political balance that day—singing praises of an economy described as “rock-solid” while hinting that the rate-cut button was always within reach. The market was thrown into a tailspin: interest rate futures lost all confidence, bets on a May cut evaporated overnight, and June transformed into a new-age gambling den. Even more surreal was the notion that a rising unemployment rate could serve as a pretext for cutting rates—a logic as absurd as recommending milk tea for a cold—turning bad news into a disguised good.</p>
<h4 id="13-trumps-twitter-economics">1.3 Trump’s “Twitter Economics”</h4>
<p>Just as the market began to catch its breath after the nonfarm report, Trump struck with a “triple tariff” blitz—raising tariffs on Mexico and Canada, threatening sanctions on Russia, and boldly declaring that tariff rates had no ceiling. The timing was so impeccably precise that it seemed as if his phone was rigged with a “short alert” system. The S&amp;P 500 surged to 5770 before being hammered back to 5666, perfectly matching the doomsday put option strike of 5675 in what appeared to be a carefully staged capital play. Observers online quipped, “Trump’s tweets are like a short-selling signal for the institutions—maybe the SEC should check if he’s running a covert short position operation!”</p>

<h3 id="ii-behind-the-scenes-of-capital-the-squid-game-on-the-charts">II. Behind the Scenes of Capital: The “Squid Game” on the Charts</h3>
<h4 id="21-the-options-markets-hunger-games">2.1 The Options Market’s “Hunger Games”</h4>
<p>At the 5740 level, doomsday puts and call options clashed in a brutal, meat-grinder showdown. Spotgamma had flagged 5740 as the make-or-break point, yet the S&amp;P 500 bottomed at 5670 and then staged a sharp V-shaped recovery, deviating by less than 5 points throughout the ordeal. This wasn’t mere market volatility—it appeared to be a high-tech financial drama, as if Wall Street were orchestrating a “Truman Show” for traders. Retail investors lamented, “All this time, we thought we were watching the market, but it turns out we were mere extras in an institutional financial series!”</p>
<h4 id="22-jpmorgans-5565-base-card">2.2 JPMorgan’s “5565 Base Card”</h4>
<p>While retail traders were busy dissecting MACD golden crosses, major institutions had already unveiled their trump card—a collar options strategy set at 5565, constructing an “iron-clad floor” ahead of the ultimate showdown on March 21, the infamous quadruple witching day. As the ancient wisdom goes, “The battle is decided before the fight begins.” Conspiracy theorists even noted that the 60-week moving average at 5545 nearly coincided with key option strike prices, suggesting that JPMorgan might even have purchased a “divine perspective.”</p>
<h4 id="23-the-vampire-pact-between-us-treasuries-and-stocks">2.3 The “Vampire Pact” Between U.S. Treasuries and Stocks</h4>
<p>Trump’s relentless assault on U.S. stocks revealed its true motive: forcing the 10-year Treasury yield below 4% to trigger a global capital return that would prop up U.S. bonds. This grand strategy—almost like a financial voodoo ritual—essentially uses retail investor losses to breathe life back into the bond market. Unsurprisingly, online commentators joked, “It used to be just a scalping of chives; now they’re even digging up the roots to make pickles!”</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="iii-the-ai-bubble-the-naked-truth-behind-tech-stocks">III. The AI Bubble: The Naked Truth Behind Tech Stocks</h3>
<h4 id="31-nvidias-trillion-dollar-evaporation">3.1 Nvidia’s “Trillion-Dollar Evaporation”</h4>
<p>AI leader Nvidia staged a “freefall” performance, watching its market value evaporate by $1 trillion—an amount comparable to wiping out Tesla’s entire market cap. Outwardly, the blame was shifted to the “impact of China’s large models,” but the real crisis was unfolding behind the scenes: downstream applications were underperforming en masse, Palantir faced accusations of profiting from data theft, and many app companies’ AI capabilities seemed little more than a single image with a fabricated storyline. The industry increasingly resembled a scenario where those selling shovels got rich while the gold miners were left starving—prompting investors to conclude that the AI revolution was nothing more than a multi-level marketing scheme for graphics cards.</p>
<h4 id="32-nasdaq-100s-11-makeup-remover">3.2 Nasdaq 100’s “11% Makeup Remover”</h4>
<p>Tech stocks collectively suffered an “unmasking blow” as the Nasdaq 100 retraced over 11%, with the combined market cap shrinkage of seven major giants rivaling the GDP of Russia. Ironically, the much-touted “AI cost reductions and efficiency gains” were nowhere to be seen in the earnings reports. For instance, Palantir’s revenue surged 50% while its headcount increased by only 3%, revealing an aggressive strategy of squeezing existing teams. One sharp-tongued online commentator summed it up: “This isn’t a technological revolution—it’s just automated workplace manipulation!”</p>
<h4 id="33-lunrs-moon-collision">3.3 LUNR’s “Moon Collision”</h4>
<p>Space funeral firm LUNR proved that landing on the moon can be even tougher than playing the stock market. After two failed landings that sent its share price tumbling with consecutive 20% drops, investor confidence was thoroughly shaken. Yet institutions wildly hinted that a third attempt would be the charm—an assurance reminiscent of a notorious playboy’s empty promises: “Sorry I was late and the gifts were fake, but I’ll do better next time!” Meanwhile, retail investors could only weep and ask, “What’s the point of these candlestick charts? Even if we see a rebound, what good does it do us?”</p>

<h4 id="41-the-sweet-trap-at-5850">4.1 The “Sweet Trap” at 5850</h4>
<p>A rebound of the S&amp;P 500 to 5850 could prove to be a deadly lure—a level cluttered with trapped long positions and option sellers, with a breakout as challenging as trying to pick up mercury with chopsticks. Even more ominous, a “quantitative time bomb” is planted at 5900, where algorithmic trading could trigger a mass sell-off and create an artificial ceiling. Retail traders chasing a rally at this juncture might end up in a very real-life “frozen at the summit” nightmare.</p>
<h4 id="42-the-blood-sacrifice-ritual-of-quadruple-witching-day">4.2 The “Blood Sacrifice Ritual” of Quadruple Witching Day</h4>
<p>March 21, quadruple witching day, is set to become the ultimate battleground between bulls and bears, with $2.4 trillion in derivatives expiring and volatility potentially soaring to new heights. Historical data shows that the second week of March has often witnessed sharp V-shaped sell-offs over the past two decades, and this year’s script might be even more brutal. If the 5565 level is breached, it could trigger a “death spiral” of algorithmic trading—leaving even Warren Buffett to remark, “In my 90 years, I’ve never seen anything this dramatic!”</p>
<h4 id="43-the-death-countdown-of-us-treasury-yields">4.3 The “Death Countdown” of U.S. Treasury Yields</h4>
<p>The day the 10-year Treasury yield falls to 4% will mark a “Deadpool-style resurrection” for U.S. stocks—the Federal Reserve will be forced to engineer a simultaneous collapse in both stocks and bonds to complete its grand capital reshuffle. However, if global central banks refuse to step in and buy U.S. Treasuries, this Ponzi-esque financial maneuver could implode. At that point, Trump might be tweeting overnight: “U.S. bankruptcy? Fake news! We’re just executing a strategic economic reset!”</p>

<h4 id="51-recognize-the-data-beauty-parlor">5.1 Recognize the “Data Beauty Parlor”</h4>
<p>Key economic indicators like nonfarm payrolls and CPI must be analyzed with a “makeup remover mindset”—pay special attention to revisions in previous readings and changes in statistical methods. When you encounter absurd logic like “a rise in unemployment means a rate cut is imminent,” remind yourself: “When all the good is gone, the bad prevails; when the bad is exhausted, the good emerges; no data is the most reliable of all!”</p>
<h4 id="52-crack-the-options-illusion">5.2 Crack the “Options Illusion”</h4>
<p>Dense zones of doomsday puts and calls are nothing more than institutions’ pre-set trap levels. When the S&amp;P 500 precisely hits the 5670 support level, don’t be seduced by the magic of technical analysis—be wary, as it’s clearly a line drawn by market makers. Retail investors should adopt a “contrarian playbook”: when others panic, act inert; when others are euphoric, shut down your trading.</p>
<h4 id="53-escape-the-ai-bad-boy-circle">5.3 Escape the “AI Bad Boy Circle”</h4>
<p>When investing in tech stocks, keep these three golden rules in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you see claims of a “revolutionary breakthrough,” mentally translate it into a “graphics card sales pitch.”</li>
<li>When a CEO promises “robust future growth,” immediately check for insider stock sell-offs.</li>
<li>When analysts are unanimously bullish, promptly inspect their put option positions.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
When nonfarm data becomes fodder for Trump’s late-night tweets and candlestick charts are manipulated like marionettes by institutional players, the only recourse for retail investors is to keep their wits about them amidst the capital frenzy. Remember—in Wall Street’s scripted drama, the truth is always hidden on page two, and that second page typically comes with a steep subscription fee.</p>
