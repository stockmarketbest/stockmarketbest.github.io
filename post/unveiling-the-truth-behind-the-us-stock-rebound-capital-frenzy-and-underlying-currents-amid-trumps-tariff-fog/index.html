                <h2 id="introduction-market-breather-or-mere-illusion">Introduction: Market Breather or Mere Illusion?</h2>
<p>On Monday, March 17, all three major US stock indices advanced, extending last Friday’s rebound and seemingly offering investors a measure of reassurance. The S&amp;P 500 rose by 0.64%, the Nasdaq inched up 0.31%, and the Dow surged 0.85%. At first glance, most stocks were on the upswing, suggesting a hint of market warmth. Yet, declines in Nvidia and Tesla acted as painful thorns against the Nasdaq’s weak points, rendering the rebound less genuine.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, February’s US retail data showed a mere 0.2% nominal growth—well below the expected 0.6%—with previous figures revised from –0.9% to –1.2%. Cold weather, delayed tax refunds, and an uncertain economic outlook have weighed heavily on consumer sentiment, confirming weak consumption. Excluding autos and gasoline, sales increased by 0.5%, slightly above the anticipated 0.4%, hinting at modest economic progress amidst the downturn. This small glimmer has temporarily eased investor anxiety, though it falls short of igniting enduring confidence.</p>
<p>Adding to the complexity, two major events loom this week: Nvidia’s GTC conference and the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision. While no one expects a rate cut, investors remain alert for any potential signals. At the same time, the White House reiterated that reciprocal tariffs will take effect on April 2, with the US Trade Representative busy streamlining the plan. Given investors’ longstanding wariness of Trump’s unpredictable tariff policies, the promise of “orderliness” has helped lower the volatility index (VIX) somewhat. Short sellers have paused and a cautious mood prevails—yet the critical question remains: is this a true turning point or merely the prelude to another round of strategic maneuvering?</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="i-the-truth-behind-the-rebound-covering-shorts-caution-and-illusory-momentum">I. The Truth Behind the Rebound: Covering Shorts, Caution, and Illusory Momentum</h2>
<h3 id="11-covering-shorts-and-easing-sentiment">1.1 Covering Shorts and Easing Sentiment</h3>
<p>A significant portion of the rebound can be attributed to short covering. Ahead of last Friday’s surge, options traders had already begun offloading their hedging instruments on the S&amp;P 500, lowering the cost of 10% downside protection to its lowest level this year. The head of derivatives at Oppenheimer remarked, “At least this week, the market can catch its breath.” Similarly, the chief strategist at Interactive Brokers noted that shifting options demand indicates a stabilization. The retreat of the VIX further corroborated this easing—fear was subsiding, short positions were being closed, and downside hedges were being lifted. However, this remains merely a temporary relaxation of sentiment; genuine confidence has yet to return.</p>
<h3 id="12-technical-factors-and-seasonal-momentum">1.2 Technical Factors and Seasonal Momentum</h3>
<p>From a technical standpoint, the Dow was the first to rebound to its annual moving average, while the S&amp;P 500 lagged behind. Although the S&amp;P 500 briefly broke above its 10-day moving average, it quickly retreated, suggesting that bullish strength was lacking. Meanwhile, oversold market sentiment and positioning indicators, coupled with the seasonal uptick expected in late March and the potential boost to corporate earnings from a weakening dollar, lent some support to the rebound. Still, this support appears rooted in technical repair rather than a true reversal in fundamentals.</p>
<h3 id="13-underlying-capital-flows-whos-watching-and-whos-betting">1.3 Underlying Capital Flows: Who’s Watching and Who’s Betting?</h3>
<p>The rebound was mainly driven by short covering and retail investors buying on dips, while fund managers remained largely on the sidelines. Hedge funds and CTAs have trimmed their equity positions—from overweight at the start of the year to underweight—without a mass exit or a significant influx of new positions. With capital inflows lacking, a V-shaped recovery seems unlikely. The uncertainty stemming from Trump’s policies hangs over the market like a sword, casting doubts on the rebound’s durability. As is often the case after a major decline, hesitance prevails; chasing high prices often leaves investors trapped in a familiar cycle.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="ii-trumps-tariff-fog-orderly-progress-or-hidden-perils">II. Trump’s Tariff Fog: Orderly Progress or Hidden Perils?</h2>
<h3 id="21-an-orderly-panacea">2.1 An “Orderly” Panacea</h3>
<p>The White House reiterated that reciprocal tariffs would come into effect on April 2. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has been busy refining the plan—going as far as soliciting public feedback—to offer the market a reassuring promise of “orderliness.” Some tariffs might be delayed and implemented only after several months of investigation. Compared to Trump’s previously capricious style, this approach has certainly eased market nerves. With the VIX on the decline and a reduction in options hedging, investors appear willing to believe that the current bout of chaos will be less severe.</p>
<h3 id="22-uncertainty-lingers">2.2 Uncertainty Lingers</h3>
<p>Yet, the Chief Economic Advisor offered a dose of cold reality: “Discussions are ongoing, and the strategy may change in the coming weeks.” Although conditions might clarify after April 2, policy uncertainty is unlikely to dissipate in the short term. The market’s unease isn’t driven by tariffs per se but by Trump’s notoriously fickle rhetoric. Could this rebound merely be the prelude to another sell-off?</p>
<h3 id="23-the-hidden-battle-in-us-treasuries-a-safe-haven-for-capital">2.3 The Hidden Battle in US Treasuries: A Safe Haven for Capital</h3>
<p>The yield on the 10-year US Treasury hovered around 4.3%, while February saw record trading volumes—a daily nominal trading value of $1.068 trillion, up 16% year-on-year. Uncertainty over Trump’s tariffs and bets on a Fed rate cut have spurred activity in the bond market. Some analysts believe that Trump and Baisent are deliberately suppressing the stock market to drive capital into Treasuries, aiming to push yields below 4%. If this strategy succeeds, the path for the US stock rebound is likely to be fraught with challenges.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="iii-polarizing-performances-divergent-fortunes-in-stocks-and-sectors">III. Polarizing Performances: Divergent Fortunes in Stocks and Sectors</h2>
<h3 id="31-affirm-the-unfortunate-fintech-player">3.1 Affirm: The Unfortunate Fintech Player</h3>
<p>Fintech company Affirm saw its stock plunge over 15% during the day after competitor Klarna replaced it as Walmart’s exclusive “buy now, pay later” provider. Although it managed to claw back some losses by the close, its decline since mid-February has exceeded 40%. With Klarna’s IPO on the horizon, Affirm’s uniqueness has evaporated, heightening the risk of capital diversion. In a slowing economy, such fintech stocks could be the first to suffer, with volatility likely to persist.</p>
<h3 id="32-nvidia-a-moment-for-old-huangs-redemption">3.2 Nvidia: A Moment for “Old Huang’s” Redemption</h3>
<p>Nvidia’s stock hit its monthly moving average before retreating, as short-term traders took profits. Tomorrow, CEO Jensen Huang is set to unveil the Blackwell B300 chip alongside the Rubin GPU architecture slated for 2026. A surprising presentation could trigger another surge, while a lackluster show might see the stock slide back to around $100. The market waits with bated breath.</p>
<h3 id="33-broadcom-a-backstab-by-a-tech-giant">3.3 Broadcom: A Backstab by a Tech Giant</h3>
<p>Broadcom experienced a downturn as Google’s plan to partner with MediaTek on AI chips raised concerns over potential order losses. With Broadcom’s revenue heavily reliant on major tech players, any shift to competitors or pricing pressure could weigh on both revenue growth and profit margins. This setback has exposed vulnerabilities in Broadcom’s business model.</p>
<h3 id="34-quantum-computing-a-bubble-fueled-by-hype">3.4 Quantum Computing: A Bubble Fueled by Hype</h3>
<p>Stocks tied to quantum computing have surged, spurred on by the GTC conference. A group of CEOs is now taking aim at Jensen Huang—both to settle scores from earlier market declines and to maneuver prices for their own benefit. However, the steep drops at the start of the year have already wiped out many retail investors, and these so-called “meme stocks” could suffer further once the hype fades.</p>
<h3 id="35-nuclear-stocks-steady-gains-amid-stability">3.5 Nuclear Stocks: Steady Gains Amid Stability</h3>
<p>Nuclear stocks rallied broadly, buoyed by the GTC conference—with VST proving to be more stable than pure-play concept stock OKLO. Although Pelosi’s held options have fallen by 50%, she has yet to sell, suggesting that retail investors might find some comfort in maintaining their positions.</p>
<h3 id="36-robinhood-a-new-speculative-play">3.6 Robinhood: A New, Speculative Play</h3>
<p>Robinhood has launched a prediction market center that allows users to wager on sports events and the Fed’s decisions—resulting in an immediate spike in its stock price. With management showing a keen sensitivity to market volatility, investors might wait for a broader market pullback before diving in.</p>
<h3 id="37-chinese-concept-stocks-riding-the-policy-tailwind">3.7 Chinese Concept Stocks: Riding the Policy Tailwind</h3>
<p>The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index soared after a State Council press conference bolstered consumer-focused policies, leading Wall Street to adopt an overwhelmingly bullish stance. With improved earnings prospects for companies in the consumer, tourism, and healthcare sectors, further gains appear likely.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="iv-market-outlook-short-term-breathing-room-long-term-pitfalls">IV. Market Outlook: Short-Term Breathing Room, Long-Term Pitfalls</h2>
<h3 id="41-how-far-can-the-rebound-go">4.1 How Far Can the Rebound Go?</h3>
<p>There are clear signs of a short-term rebound in the US stock market, but with insufficient capital inflows, a V-shaped recovery seems unlikely. The erratic nature of Trump’s policies continues to cast a long shadow, leaving the durability of the rebound in serious doubt.</p>
<h3 id="42-investment-strategy-take-profits-when-the-opportunity-arises">4.2 Investment Strategy: Take Profits When the Opportunity Arises</h3>
<p>Investors should closely monitor the 5-day moving average—if the daily chart holds above it, the rebound appears viable; if it breaks, it may be time to exit. On the individual stock front, Affirm, Nvidia, and Broadcom each have their own merits, while quantum computing and nuclear stocks might be well-suited for short-term trades. Robinhood and Chinese concept stocks could present attractive entry points during a market pullback.</p>
<h3 id="43-the-hidden-battle-between-us-treasuries-and-interest-rates">4.3 The Hidden Battle Between US Treasuries and Interest Rates</h3>
<p>If the yield on the 10-year Treasury falls below 4%, pressure from capital outflows could intensify. Should Trump and Baisent’s strategy come to fruition, this rebound might prove to be nothing more than a fleeting phenomenon.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclusion-the-game-is-not-over-and-the-fog-persists">Conclusion: The Game Is Not Over, and the Fog Persists</h2>
<p>The recent US stock market rebound was driven in large part by short covering and retail investors buying the dip, yet the real story lies in the policy maneuvers shrouded in Trump’s tariff fog. While the market may enjoy temporary stability, long-term risks remain unresolved, leaving investors treading cautiously. Seizing rebound opportunities and adjusting positions flexibly will be crucial for navigating the ongoing uncertainty. In a scenario where a single word from Trump can flip the game, who can truly claim to have seen it all coming?</p>
