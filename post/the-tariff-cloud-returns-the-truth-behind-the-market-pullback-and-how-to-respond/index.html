                <p>Hello everyone, and welcome to this week’s market recap. The past few days have felt like a roller coaster, with the S&amp;P 500 hitting 5968 before abruptly reversing course, sparking a wave of risk-off sentiment. Meanwhile, Trump’s latest tweet dropped like a depth charge: effective June 1, a 50% tariff on the EU, and a 25% punitive tariff on Apple. And that’s not all—weak demand at the 20-year Treasury auction, stalled peace talks in the Middle East—uncertainties keep piling up, stretching investors’ nerves thin.</p>
<p>Faced with this situation, will you panic and sell, or stay calm and seek opportunities? This article unpacks the current market landscape from five angles: tariff policy, macroeconomic indicators, CTA dynamics, technical analysis, and corporate earnings. The goal? To answer a core question: Is this pullback just a short-term blip, or the prelude to something bigger? More importantly, we'll approach this with independent thinking and a critical spirit—exploring how to find your footing in the chaos.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-tariff-policy-the-political-chessboard-and-economic-price-tag">1. Tariff Policy: The Political Chessboard and Economic Price Tag</h2>
<p>Trump’s tariff hammer is swinging again, this time targeting the EU and Apple. A 50% tariff on the EU, and a 25% punitive tariff directly aimed at Apple’s overseas manufacturing. This isn’t just economic policy—it’s naked political maneuvering.</p>
<h3 id="11-historical-lessons-the-double-edged-sword-of-tariffs">1.1 Historical Lessons: The Double-Edged Sword of Tariffs</h3>
<p>Tariffs are nothing new. The 1929 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act ignited a global trade war, worsening the Great Depression. The 2018 US-China trade war saw markets whipsawed by multiple rounds of tariff escalations. Trump clearly isn’t too concerned with history’s lessons. His logic is blunt: use tariffs to force manufacturing back to the US and restore American economic &quot;greatness.&quot; But can you really dismantle and rebuild global supply chains so easily? If Apple were to relocate production to the US, analysts estimate costs would soar to $3,500 per device—more fairy tale than reality. Would consumers pay for that?</p>
<h3 id="12-market-reaction-panic-or-opportunity">1.2 Market Reaction: Panic or Opportunity?</h3>
<p>The S&amp;P 500's pullback reflects immediate concerns over tariff uncertainties. But as the <em>Overreaction Bias</em> in psychology teaches us, markets often exaggerate fear in the short term. Ironically, this very fear creates buying opportunities for rational investors. EU stocks, Apple’s supply chain—these may face short-term pressure, but are they fundamentally undervalued? That’s a question only you can answer—don’t blindly follow Wall Street’s “expert” predictions.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-macroeconomic-indicators-the-power-plays-behind-the-data">2. Macroeconomic Indicators: The Power Plays Behind the Data</h2>
<p>Beyond tariffs, upcoming data releases—PCE inflation, GDP revisions, and the Fed’s meeting minutes—will shape the market narrative. These aren’t just economic health check-ups; they’re also clues to the Fed’s policy direction.</p>
<h3 id="21-pce-data-the-inflation-pressure-point">2.1 PCE Data: The Inflation Pressure Point</h3>
<p>On May 30, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge—the PCE index—will drop. CPI and PPI have recently cooled, but PCE is the real &quot;ace&quot; in the deck. If inflation shows signs of easing, rate-cut expectations could heat up, sparking a market rally. If not, the Fed’s hawkish stance may keep the pressure on. Don’t be surprised when Wall Street analysts start their next round of forecasting games.</p>
<h3 id="22-gdp-revisions-act-two-of-the-economic-story">2.2 GDP Revisions: Act Two of the Economic Story</h3>
<p>On May 29, the revised Q1 GDP will be released. The initial estimate showed a -0.3% contraction due to trade imbalances. This revision is a key test of the US economy’s resilience. Continued weakness could fuel recession fears; any improvement might ease pressure. Remember: GDP numbers aren’t just economic stats—they’re part of a political narrative.</p>
<h3 id="23-fed-meeting-minutes-whispers-of-power">2.3 Fed Meeting Minutes: Whispers of Power</h3>
<p>On May 28, we’ll see the Fed’s meeting minutes from three weeks ago. Any hints of a shift in Powell’s “Flexible Average Inflation Targeting” (FAIT) strategy? Under the twin pressures of inflation and growth, will the Fed stick to its “see no evil, hear no evil” stance, or be forced to adjust? These minutes are more than just policy signals—they’re glimpses into the power struggle behind closed doors.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="3-cta-dynamics-the-hidden-hands-behind-the-market">3. CTA Dynamics: The Hidden Hands Behind the Market</h2>
<p>CTAs (Commodity Trading Advisors) are major players in the futures and options markets, amplifying market moves. Goldman Sachs’ latest report warns that if the market continues to decline, CTAs could dump up to $98.4 billion in assets over the next month. That’s not a typo. Think of it as a swarm of algorithm-driven “cold-blooded machines” ready to hit the gas and turn a dip into an avalanche.</p>
<h3 id="31-the-logic-of-trend-following">3.1 The Logic of Trend-Following</h3>
<p>CTA strategies are all about trend-following: buy on strength, sell on weakness. When markets are trending clearly, this can be powerful. In choppy markets, though, they act as “noise amplifiers.” While retail investors worry over pullbacks, CTAs are already smashing the sell button without a hint of mercy.</p>
<h3 id="32-what-this-means-for-you">3.2 What This Means for You</h3>
<p>Faced with potential CTA selling pressure, should investors panic? No. Instead, watch key levels—S&amp;P 5665 and the 200-day moving average—and assess fundamentals alongside. CTAs are big, but they’re just algorithms. Algorithms are static; humans can think. Can you break free from the herd and think for yourself?</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="4-technical-analysis-signals-and-traps-in-the-charts">4. Technical Analysis: Signals and Traps in the Charts</h2>
<p>Technical analysis is an investor’s “telescope”—it helps spot market patterns. But it’s also a “funhouse mirror”—it can distort reality.</p>
<h3 id="41-the-sp-500s-head-and-shoulders-shadow">4.1 The S&amp;P 500’s Head-and-Shoulders Shadow</h3>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 appears to be forming a head-and-shoulders pattern, with neckline support at 5665. A break below could target 5500. This pattern is a classic reversal signal, but remember: markets don’t follow scripts. Whether the 200-day moving average (around 5800) holds will be key to short-term direction.</p>
<h3 id="42-the-200-day-moving-average-faith-vs-reality">4.2 The 200-Day Moving Average: Faith vs. Reality</h3>
<p>Many technical traders see the 200-day moving average as the line between bullish and bearish. Right now, the index is hovering near this line, with solid candlestick patterns showing the bulls still have some fight. If it breaks, the consequences could be severe. Will you treat technicals as gospel, or question their relevance? The choice is yours.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="5-corporate-earnings-pivotal-moments-for-nvidia-and-tesla">5. Corporate Earnings: Pivotal Moments for NVIDIA and Tesla</h2>
<p>Individual earnings reports are market sentiment magnifiers—especially for NVIDIA and Tesla in the coming week.</p>
<h3 id="51-nvidia-the-ai-titan-at-a-crossroads">5.1 NVIDIA: The AI Titan at a Crossroads</h3>
<p>NVIDIA reports after the close on May 28. As the poster child of the AI boom, its results affect not just its own stock, but the entire tech sector. Key points to watch: the impact of the $5.5 billion export restrictions, Blackwell chip demand outlook, and CEO Jensen Huang’s forward guidance. If the report is strong, tech stocks could soar; if guidance is weak, the selloff may deepen. Remember: with a $3 trillion market cap, Wall Street may be suffering “story fatigue.” Can NVIDIA keep the narrative going?</p>
<h3 id="52-tesla-the-tug-of-war-between-deliveries-and-dreams">5.2 Tesla: The Tug-of-War Between Deliveries and Dreams</h3>
<p>For Tesla, it’s all about delivery numbers and progress on autonomous driving. Q1 deliveries fell by 50,000 year-over-year, putting annual targets at risk. The June 30 FSD (Full Self-Driving) beta is a potential catalyst, but safety risks lurk. How long can Musk’s “dream” hold? It all depends on whether the data backs up the promises. The $350 trading range is both a ceiling and a potential opportunity—will you take the bet?</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="6-a-decentralized-perspective-the-power-of-information-freedom">6. A Decentralized Perspective: The Power of Information Freedom</h2>
<p>In chaotic markets, access to information and judgment is everything. But mainstream media and “expert opinions” often carry bias—or outright mislead. As “Program-Think” (a well-known Chinese blogger) repeatedly emphasized, information freedom and decentralized thinking are the antidotes to brainwashing.</p>
<h3 id="61-beware-the-single-narrative">6.1 Beware the Single Narrative</h3>
<p>Tariff policies, Fed moves, CTA selling—there are vested interests behind all of these stories. Is Trump’s tweet really about the economy, or is it just election posturing? Is Goldman Sachs’ report objective analysis, or market manipulation? Instead of blindly following a single narrative, verify across multiple sources and piece together the truth.</p>
<h3 id="62-the-reward-of-independent-thinking">6.2 The Reward of Independent Thinking</h3>
<p>Markets are full of noise—but independent thinkers are rare. When retail inflows hit record highs, and the Fear &amp; Greed Index spikes to extremes, the principle of mean reversion often kicks in. Don’t let emotions or “experts” hijack your judgment. Do your own analysis—that’s how you take responsibility for your wealth.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclusion-the-wisdom-of-winning-amid-chaos">Conclusion: The Wisdom of Winning Amid Chaos</h2>
<p>Markets are battlefields—uncertain and full of opportunities. Tariffs, macro data, CTA selling, technical signals, earnings reports—these factors weave a complex tapestry. But no matter how the market evolves, the core principles remain: stay rational, think critically, reject the herd mentality.</p>
<p>A pullback is both a risk and a test. Smart investors seek undervalued assets amid fear and stay clear-eyed in times of greed. As technical analysis legend John Murphy said: “The market is always right, but it’s never fair.” Don’t complain about volatility—learn to dance with it.</p>
<p>Finally, one last thought: <strong>Information freedom is your weapon. Independent thinking is your armor.</strong> In this unpredictable world, only by owning your judgment can you stay undefeated in the market.</p>
