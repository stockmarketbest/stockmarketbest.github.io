                <p>Hi everyone, today is Friday, May 16, 2025. The U.S. stock market has gone wild this week. All three major indices have surged — the S&amp;P 500 has rallied for five straight weeks, up 5.3% in total, and the Nasdaq’s QQQ has skyrocketed 6.87%. This is a textbook case of a mindless bull run. Economic data has been lackluster, but falling Treasury yields have added fuel to the fire. Easing global trade tensions and better-than-expected earnings have markets in euphoria. But just as Wall Street is throwing a party, Trump suddenly lobbed a “tariff bomb,” threatening to unilaterally impose new tariff rates in the next two to three weeks. Is this just a bluff, or is he really about to flip the table? Can U.S. stocks keep rising without a care? Let’s dig into the truth and the risks behind this market madness.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-us-stocks-in-a-mindless-surge-has-the-bull-market-gone-too-far">1. U.S. Stocks in a “Mindless Surge”: Has the Bull Market Gone Too Far?</h2>
<h3 id="11-technicals-short-squeeze-trampling-everything">1.1 Technicals: Short Squeeze Trampling Everything</h3>
<p>Let’s talk about just how extreme this rally has been. The S&amp;P 500 is firmly above its 5-day moving average and keeps grinding higher like it’s on steroids. People used to speculate about how high this squeeze could go — now they’re all silent. Why? Because short squeezes don’t follow logic. Every “ceiling” you thought existed has been trampled. What seemed impossible is now the norm. This rally isn’t backed by fundamentals — it’s driven by emotion and technical momentum. Shorts are being crushed, forced to cover, which pushes prices even higher.</p>
<h3 id="12-fundamentals-bad-news-cant-even-dent-it">1.2 Fundamentals: Bad News Can’t Even Dent It</h3>
<p>What’s even crazier is how the market is shrugging off bad news. Today, the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index hit its second-lowest level in history, and both short- and long-term inflation expectations spiked to multi-decade highs. By all accounts, this should’ve been bad for stocks — but markets didn’t even flinch. Instead, they kept inching higher throughout the day. This tells us two things: First, investors don’t care about “soft data” anymore; and second, once a short squeeze is in full swing, it takes a catastrophe to stop it. Bad news? This market turns it into a bullish narrative. This kind of “rising on bad news” environment is a classic sign of sentiment-driven euphoria.</p>
<h3 id="13-whats-the-real-driver-behind-this-bull-run">1.3 What’s the Real Driver Behind This Bull Run?</h3>
<p>Why are U.S. stocks so unstoppable? Simple — this isn’t a typical bull market. It’s a bull market backed by <strong>national willpower</strong>. The Fed’s “put” and the White House’s “put” aren’t just talk — they’re institutional mechanisms designed to protect the market. Americans have their wealth and retirement savings tied up in stocks. If the stock market collapses, the bond market, banks, and credit systems could all follow. No one in D.C. is willing to let that happen. With QE in play, the game has changed entirely. If you’re still using a 2008 or 2000 lens to view today’s market, you’re basically trying to drive a Porsche with horse-and-buggy experience — no wonder the market leaves you in the dust.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-trumps-tariff-bomb-bluff-or-trade-war-20">2. Trump’s “Tariff Bomb”: Bluff or Trade War 2.0?</h2>
<h3 id="21-surprise-warning-unilateral-tariffs-coming">2.1 Surprise Warning: Unilateral Tariffs Coming?</h3>
<p>Just as markets were partying, Trump dropped a bombshell: within two to three weeks, he might <strong>unilaterally</strong> set new tariff rates for trade partners — no negotiations. This could mean talks have stalled or he’s applying pressure: “Cooperate now or I’ll go it alone!” If he follows through, trade tensions will spike again and uncertainty will shoot through the roof. And yet… markets are acting like they didn’t even hear it. This blind optimism feels eerily similar to the craziness before “Tariff Freedom Day” back on April 2.</p>
<h3 id="22-market-reaction-shrugging-it-off">2.2 Market Reaction: Shrugging It Off</h3>
<p>Why is Wall Street so calm? Most investors believe Trump won’t go full scorched-earth — maybe just impose a 10% baseline tariff as a bluff. But isn’t that dangerously naive? Trump has never played by the rules. When he says stuff like this, it’s usually a preview of what’s coming: turbulence ahead. But Wall Street still seems to believe the Fed has its back, so they keep partying. This kind of attitude is like gambling with your life.</p>
<h3 id="23-the-real-risk-is-trade-war-20-coming">2.3 The Real Risk: Is Trade War 2.0 Coming?</h3>
<p>Trade wars are never a minor issue. If Trump really unleashes new tariffs, global supply chains will shake. Export-heavy companies will see costs rise and profits shrink. How long can their stock prices hold up? Inflation expectations are already high — throw in new tariffs and prices could skyrocket. What will the Fed do then? Raise rates to fight inflation and hurt stocks? Or hold off and let inflation spiral? This “tariff bomb” could be far more destructive than people think.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="3-the-secret-behind-the-bull-market-guess-the-bottom-not-the-top">3. The Secret Behind the Bull Market: Guess the Bottom, Not the Top!</h2>
<h3 id="31-v-shaped-reversals-the-markets-superpower">3.1 V-Shaped Reversals: The Market’s Superpower</h3>
<p>This recent V-shaped rebound really proves that old saying: “In the U.S., bull markets last longer, and bear markets are short-lived.” No matter how bad the drop looks, the market bounces back like it’s on Red Bull. You can criticize the lack of logic, but you can’t deny the strength of these rebounds. In this market, you can try to guess the bottom — but don’t bother guessing the top. Why? Because the bottom is protected by the government, and the top… no one knows how high it can go.</p>
<h3 id="32-system-level-backing-the-fed-and-white-house-as-twin-pillars">3.2 System-Level Backing: The Fed and White House as Twin Pillars</h3>
<p>The reason? The U.S. stock market isn’t just an investment vehicle — it’s the financial backbone of the country. Family wealth, pensions, and the entire financial system are tied to it. A stock crash would trigger a cascade of collapses. The Fed’s QE and White House’s interventions aren’t theoretical — they’re hardwired into the system. Back in 2008, people panicked over a 20-30% drop. Now? Everyone’s used to it. With a “big daddy” backing the market, what’s there to fear?</p>
<h3 id="33-investor-takeaway-drop-the-baggage-of-past-crises">3.3 Investor Takeaway: Drop the Baggage of Past Crises</h3>
<p>So, for anyone still stuck in the mindset of the 2008 or 2000 crashes — it’s time to move on. The next time stocks crash 20-30%, don’t just panic-sell. Bring cash and courage and look for entry points. That said, I’m not telling you to jump in right now. Yes, the trend is strong, but valuations are sky-high. Buying now could mean becoming exit liquidity. Shorting? No clear signals either. The smartest move is to wait — wait for a real bear signal, then strike hard.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="4-institutional-moves-what-are-the-big-players-planning">4. Institutional Moves: What Are the Big Players Planning?</h2>
<h3 id="41-13f-reports-defensive-positions-everywhere">4.1 13F Reports: Defensive Positions Everywhere</h3>
<p>The latest 13F filings show a very cautious tone from institutions. Overall, Q1 saw most funds tightening up and going defensive. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway sold more stocks and piled up record cash. It dumped Citigroup and some Brazilian banks, reduced stakes in Bank of America and Capital One — Buffett is clearly waiting on the sidelines. Bridgewater was even more conservative, slashing SPY, Google, and Nvidia while loading up on gold ETFs like it’s preparing for disaster.</p>
<h3 id="42-michael-burry-going-all-in-on-doom">4.2 Michael Burry: Going All In on Doom</h3>
<p>Then there’s Michael Burry, the original “Big Short.” His Q1 moves were shocking — he liquidated nearly everything, leaving only Estée Lauder, which he boosted to 200,000 shares, while loading up on puts against Nvidia and Chinese tech stocks. Either he knows something we don’t, or he’s making a massive bet. George Soros’s fund also slashed UnitedHealth and loaded up on puts — and with the stock’s big drop in April and May, they probably made a killing.</p>
<h3 id="43-nvidia-still-the-king-of-ai-bets">4.3 Nvidia: Still the King of AI Bets</h3>
<p>As for Nvidia, they made a bold new Q1 investment in CoreWeave — 24.18 million shares worth $897 million, making up over 78% of their portfolio. They’re clearly all in on AI. But keep in mind, these are Q1 numbers — it’s already May, and markets have shifted several times. How accurate are these holdings now? You’ll have to dig in and decide for yourself this weekend.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="5-trumps-middle-east-trip-mega-deals-shock-the-market">5. Trump’s Middle East Trip: Mega Deals Shock the Market</h2>
<h3 id="51-defense-boom-142-billion-in-arms-sales">5.1 Defense Boom: $142 Billion in Arms Sales</h3>
<p>Trump’s latest Middle East trip saw him leading a delegation of business leaders and landing hundreds of billions in deals. In defense alone, the U.S. pre-approved a $142 billion arms package to Saudi Arabia — a record-breaking export. Missiles, air defense systems, anti-missile tech, F-35 jets — everything’s included. Defense stocks like Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTX) are probably celebrating already. Expectations for the sector just went through the roof.</p>
<h3 id="52-aviation-and-tech-also-booming">5.2 Aviation and Tech Also Booming</h3>
<p>Aerospace wasn’t left out — Boeing (BA) and GE Aerospace snagged a $96 billion deal with Qatar Airways. Delta (DAL) signed a code-share with Saudia that could net an extra $420 million annually. In tech, Nvidia and AMD signed hundreds of billions in AI chip deals with Saudi-backed Humain. Micron (MU), TSMC — all benefited. Even Amazon (AMZN) joined in, investing $5 billion with Humain to build an AI computing platform. AWS continues to prove its dominance.</p>
<h3 id="53-energy-pivot-aramco-teams-up-with-exxon">5.3 Energy Pivot: Aramco Teams Up with Exxon</h3>
<p>On the energy front, Saudi Aramco and ExxonMobil (XOM) agreed on initial terms for refining and LNG projects. With deals across defense, aviation, tech, and energy, this Middle East trip injected confidence into every sector of the U.S. market. But here’s the catch: Can these deals really be delivered on? Or are they just big promises driving market hype?</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="6-stock-highlights-winners-and-losers">6. Stock Highlights: Winners and Losers</h2>
<h3 id="61-applied-materials-amat-ai-cant-save-its-china-slump">6.1 Applied Materials (AMAT): AI Can’t Save Its China Slump</h3>
<p>U.S. chip giant Applied Materials (AMAT) hasn’t had a great time. Their latest Q2 earnings missed estimates, and Q3 guidance is weak. China revenues plunged from 43% to 25% of total sales. Auto and industrial orders are slowing, and only AI demand is keeping things afloat. But how long can that last?</p>
<h3 id="62-novo-nordisk-nvo-weight-loss-king-hits-a-wall">6.2 Novo Nordisk (NVO): Weight Loss King Hits a Wall</h3>
<p>Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk is also hurting. Increased competition in the weight loss drug market is piling pressure on CEO Jorgensen, who’s stepping down after 8 years. Under his leadership, Novo became the global leader in diabetes and weight loss drugs — hitting a record $145/share last June. But now? Trial failures, a stronger rival drug from Eli Lilly, and lowered guidance have sent the stock down 60% over the past year. Want to bottom-fish? Wait for the new CEO first.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="7-conclusion-beneath-the-euphoria-trouble-is-brewing">7. Conclusion: Beneath the Euphoria, Trouble Is Brewing</h2>
<h3 id="71-blind-optimism-whats-the-market-really-betting-on">7.1 Blind Optimism: What’s the Market Really Betting On?</h3>
<p>The market’s current euphoria is both thrilling and terrifying. Everyone’s betting that Trump’s “tariff nuke” is just a bluff and that any new rates will be manageable. But what if they’re wrong? A renewed trade war, runaway inflation, and a sharp market correction aren’t off the table. Trump excels at surprise moves — this could be his warning: don’t get too drunk on the party.</p>
<h3 id="72-investment-advice-cash-is-king-be-patient">7.2 Investment Advice: Cash Is King, Be Patient</h3>
<p>So, what’s the smart play right now? Don’t rush to go all-in. Yes, momentum is strong, but valuations are dangerously high. Chasing now could turn you into someone else’s exit. No clear short signals either, so don’t gamble blindly. The best approach? Hold cash, watch closely, and when the next 20–30% crash hits — strike hard. In U.S. markets, the deeper the drop, the stronger the rebound. The question is: do you have the guts to buy when everyone else is running?</p>
<h3 id="73-big-picture-learning-from-history-betting-on-the-future">7.3 Big Picture: Learning From History, Betting on the Future</h3>
<p>Here’s the bottom line: Since the invention of QE, the logic of financial markets has fundamentally changed. Past crisis models no longer apply. If you keep clinging to old thinking, you’ll just miss the next big opportunity. This wild bull market is backed by national willpower — long bulls and short bears are the new normal. But the crazier the bull, the deeper the hidden risks. Trump’s “tariff bomb” is just a teaser. The real test lies ahead. Keep your eyes open, your hands steady, and don’t let this party make you forget the dangers beneath.</p>
