                <p>Hi everyone, today is Thursday, May 15, 2025. The U.S. stock market has been a rollercoaster lately—major indexes are moving in different directions. After a six-day rally, tech stocks are finally buckling under the pressure, and some investors are cashing out. Meanwhile, capital in the market is running wild, rotating into cyclical stocks, and U.S. economic data keeps hitting like wave after wave. Market sentiment is as wild as a rave party. As a seasoned veteran in the financial world, I’m here to break it all down: what’s really going on, and whether investing in this market is still worth your time.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-market-overview-how-everyones-reacting-under-a-data-barrage">1. Market Overview: How Everyone's Reacting Under a Data Barrage</h2>
<h3 id="11-economic-data-stability-with-twistsinterpretations-are-all-over-the-place">1.1 Economic Data: Stability with Twists—Interpretations Are All Over the Place</h3>
<p>First, the numbers: Initial jobless claims last week held steady at 229,000—right in line with expectations. The labor market is still holding strong. April retail sales rose 0.1% month-over-month, slightly better than the 0% forecast but a far cry from March’s 1.5% surge. Still, since the data didn’t show a collapse, recession fears eased a bit.</p>
<p>But the spotlight was on April’s PPI (Producer Price Index), which surprised markets: up 2.4% year-over-year, lower than the expected 2.5%, marking the third straight monthly decline. Even more shocking was the -0.5% month-over-month drop—the lowest since April 2020. Markets had expected a 0.2% increase. Bears claim tariffs are squeezing corporate profits, while bulls say this signals easing inflation, with falling real estate and energy costs offsetting the tariff burden. I side with the bulls—10-year Treasury yields dipping below 4.5% provide some market support.</p>
<p>Right now, the market feels like a giant casino. Good or bad data can all be spun as positive. Retail investors watch the show; institutions write the narrative. Whoever shouts loudest wins.</p>
<h3 id="12-powell-speaks-talking-without-saying-much">1.2 Powell Speaks: Talking Without Saying Much</h3>
<p>Fed Chair Jerome Powell made another round today. As usual, he reiterated the 2% inflation target and mentioned that long-term rates might rise due to structural changes, implying inflation could be more persistent than in the 2010s. The market basically yawned—his remarks have become white noise at this point.</p>
<p>What really caught attention were trade agreements. The U.S. and China just struck a temporary deal, and now the EU, India, and Japan are scrambling to make their own. The EU's trade rep is pounding the table, Japan's foreign minister is flying to the U.S. next week, and even opposition parties are proposing wild ideas: reinvest U.S. bond yields into ultra-long bonds and use that to buy American-made Japanese cars in exchange for tariff exemptions. Japan holds over $1 trillion in U.S. Treasuries—if this move works, it could plug Trump’s deficit hole <em>and</em> protect Japan’s auto industry. It's a masterclass in political groveling—elegant yet submissive.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-tariff-storm-markets-are-weirdly-calm">2. Tariff Storm: Markets Are Weirdly Calm</h2>
<h3 id="21-10-tariff-just-a-slap-on-the-wrist">2.1 10% Tariff: Just a Slap on the Wrist</h3>
<p>Markets barely reacted to the tariff news. With how high U.S. stocks have climbed, trade positives are already priced in. A 10% global tariff sounds scary, but Wall Street believes it's manageable. Supply chains can absorb some of the impact, and consumer pressure won't be as bad as feared. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America have all shifted their tone, now saying the U.S. economy won’t tank this year. BofA is even betting Q2 GDP will grow 2%, citing trade deals, tax cuts, and deregulation. These same folks were calling for a recession just last quarter. Talk about flipping like a weather vane.</p>
<h3 id="22-sp-500-cant-rally-hard-but-not-crashing-either">2.2 S&amp;P 500: Can't Rally Hard, But Not Crashing Either</h3>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 is still grinding higher. Trading volume isn’t explosive, but it’s decent. Short term, some profit-taking is expected, but as long as it stays above the 200-day moving average, any dip is just noise and buyers will likely step in. Unless we get a sharp down day that breaks both the 200- and 250-day lines, there’s no real correction yet. Stock buybacks and sidelined cash are still supporting the market, so a deep drop looks unlikely for now.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="3-earnings-season-beating-expectations-is-the-new-normal">3. Earnings Season: Beating Expectations Is the New Normal?</h2>
<h3 id="31-q1-report-card-earnings-up-131">3.1 Q1 Report Card: Earnings Up 13.1%</h3>
<p>Q1 earnings season is nearly over. 80% of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported, with 77% beating expectations. Overall earnings are up 13.1%, smashing the early forecast of 6.6%. This entire rally has been earnings-driven. Wall Street now expects 2025 earnings growth at 9.4%, down from the earlier 12.5% estimate, but still solid. The current P/E ratio is 22.5x, and it’s expected to drop to 20.3x by the end of 2026—meaning the U.S. stock market still has legs.</p>
<h3 id="32-fading-momentum-retail-pulls-back-institutions-wait-and-see">3.2 Fading Momentum: Retail Pulls Back, Institutions Wait and See</h3>
<p>But after such a big run-up, the momentum is clearly cooling. JPMorgan reports retail buying enthusiasm has waned, and hedge fund short-covering has largely wrapped up. Now the market’s mood is shifting from cautiously bullish to cautiously neutral.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="4-oil-prices-and-individual-stocks-total-chaos">4. Oil Prices and Individual Stocks: Total Chaos</h2>
<h3 id="41-oil-crash-blame-the-nuclear-deal">4.1 Oil Crash: Blame the Nuclear Deal?</h3>
<p>Crude oil prices tanked today, wiping out gains from earlier this week. Rumors are swirling that the U.S. and Iran might strike a nuclear deal, boosting oil supply by year-end. OPEC+ is also considering increasing production. The oil market is now in full confusion mode.</p>
<h3 id="42-stock-watch-winners-and-losers-all-over-the-place">4.2 Stock Watch: Winners and Losers All Over the Place</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Walmart</strong>: Mixed earnings. Revenue rose 2.5%, slightly below forecasts, but adjusted EPS beat expectations. The CFO warned that tariff-driven price hikes are coming this month, but full-year guidance remains unchanged. Stock opened lower but recovered slightly to close with a small loss—investors weren’t too concerned.</li>
<li><strong>Apple</strong>: Stock is flatlined. CEO Tim Cook is busy setting up factories in India to move away from China. But Trump called him from Qatar, scolding him for relocating and demanding Apple return to the U.S. Cook stayed silent—moving back would crush margins unless Apple follows NVIDIA’s playbook and gets Middle Eastern sovereign funds to underwrite.</li>
<li><strong>NVIDIA</strong>: Just signed a $4B deal with OpenAI, and backorders from CoreWeave have piled up to $29.9B. Earnings crushed expectations, but massive capex spending spooked investors. The stock whipsawed before closing down, sparking heated debates among bulls and bears.</li>
<li><strong>UnitedHealth</strong>: This one truly crashed—down 11%, hitting a low of $248.88, breaking key support. The Wall Street Journal reported the DOJ is investigating it for Medicare fraud. The company denies it. Down 50% in a month—wiping out five years of gains. A blue-chip gone MEME. Who says investing isn't gambling?</li>
<li><strong>Humana</strong>: Dropped with the sector, but formed a hammer candlestick on the daily chart—possible short-term bottom forming.</li>
<li><strong>Coinbase</strong>: Hacked again. Data breach caused estimated losses of $180M to $400M. Stock dropped 7.2%. Ugly.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="5-the-meme-ification-of-markets-is-investing-just-gambling-now">5. The MEME-ification of Markets: Is Investing Just Gambling Now?</h2>
<h3 id="51-even-blue-chips-go-crazy-the-unitedhealth-debacle">5.1 Even Blue-Chips Go Crazy: The UnitedHealth Debacle</h3>
<p>The U.S. market has gone full MEME. UnitedHealth got halved in a month. SMCI had a similar fate earlier. Blue-chips now behave like MEME stocks. Retail investors are yelling about bankruptcy while the stock tanks to $100 or $150. Meanwhile, big funds are dumping. But BlackRock and Vanguard <em>increased</em> their holdings in Q1. Personally, I don’t think the company is doomed. Healthcare is a necessity. They’ve got $30B in cash and can survive any fines. I picked up some shares at $280 and $250—small long-term position. If it drops more, I’ll add; if it pops, I’ll trim. Not worried about short-term noise.</p>
<h3 id="52-new-investment-logic-probability-rules-emotion-doesnt">5.2 New Investment Logic: Probability Rules, Emotion Doesn’t</h3>
<p>This market is starting to feel like a casino. Stock prices shoot around like rockets. But investing fundamentals haven’t changed—it’s all about probabilities. Investing is like running a business: focus on the big picture. UnitedHealth may be buried in short-term pain, but the fundamentals are still intact. Once the dust settles, it won’t be at this price. If you went all-in short-term just because I bought, and you lost 30%—that’s on you, not me. You need your own logic. Don’t blindly follow the herd.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="6-final-thoughts-what-can-you-still-trust-in-2025">6. Final Thoughts: What Can You Still Trust in 2025?</h2>
<p>In this MEME-ified market, sentiment swings wildly, and stock prices are like wild horses. Investing feels more like gambling every day. But even gambling has odds. The key is having a trading plan and sticking to it. No matter how chaotic the market gets, there are always opportunities—for those who stay clear-headed. In 2025, stay rational. Manage your risk. Don’t let emotion lead you by the nose. For us retail traders, just surviving means you’re winning.</p>
